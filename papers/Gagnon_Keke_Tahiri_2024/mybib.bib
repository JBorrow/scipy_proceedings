A total of 14 environmental predictors were used to model sediment characteristics around Iceland on regional scale. Two approaches were used: Multivariate Adaptation Regression Splines (MARS) and randomForest regression models. RandomForest outperformed MARS in predicting grain size distribution. MARS models had a greater tendency to over− and underpredict sediment values in areas outside the environmental envelope defined by the training dataset. We provide first GIS layers on sediment characteristics around Iceland, that can be used as predictors in future models. Although models performed well, more samples, especially from the shelf areas, will be needed to improve the models in future.},

	abstract = {The northeastern part of the North Atlantic is unique in the sense that it is much warmer in the surface than other ocean areas at similar latitudes. The main reason for this is the large northward transport of heat that extends to high latitudes and crosses the Greenland–Scotland Ridge to enter the Nordic Seas and the Arctic. There the warm Atlantic water is converted to colder water masses that return southwards over the ridge partly as surface outflows and partly as overflows through the deep passages across the ridge. In this paper, the state of knowledge on the exchanges especially across the eastern part of the Greenland–Scotland Ridge is reviewed based on results from the ICES NANSEN (North Atlantic–Norwegian Sea Exchanges) project, from the Nordic WOCE project and from other sources. The accumulated evidence allows us to describe the exchanges in fair detail; the origins of the waters, the patterns of their flow towards and over the ridge and their ultimate fate. There is also increasing information on temporal variations of the exchanges although dynamical changes are still not well understood. Quantitative estimates for the volume transport of most of the overflow branches seem reasonably well established, and transport measurements of the Atlantic inflows to the Nordic Seas are approaching acceptable levels of confidence which allows preliminary budgets to be presented. The deep overflows are driven by pressure gradients set up by the formation of deep and intermediate water. The dominance of deep overflows over surface outflows in the water budget argues that this thermohaline forcing also dominates over direct wind stress and estuarine forcing in driving the Atlantic water inflow across the Greenland–Scotland Ridge, while wind stress seems to influence the characteristics and distribution of the Atlantic water north of the ridge.},

	abstract = {The Greenland–Scotland Ridge (GSR) is a major topographic feature, extending from Greenland to Scotland. It constrains the water exchange between the northernmost North Atlantic Ocean and the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas (GIN Seas) and thus forms a potential barrier for faunal exchange from the Arctic to the North Atlantic (and vice versa). Recently an increase in Atlantic water inflow has been observed, leading to changes in physical parameters (i.e. temperature and salinity), which may have an impact on the resident fauna. In this study, we analyzed the composition and distribution of six selected genera of the isopod family Munnopsidae (Crustacea) occurring north and south of the GSR. We examined 82 epibenthic sledge samples and 26 additional sub-samples taken in the course of the Benthic Invertebrates of Icelandic Waters (BIOICE) and Icelandic Marine Animals: Genetics and Ecology (IceAGE) projects, respectively, covering a total depth range from 103 to 2752m depth. Overall, 58 of the evaluated stations originated in the area north of the GSR, while the remaining 50 samples were collected south of the ridge. In total, 10517 individuals could be assigned to 15 species, most belonging to the genus Eurycope Sars, 1864. Due to the presence of the GSR as well as differences in the environment, we expected significant dissimilarities in faunal composition between the two study areas. However, most species (8) occurred on both sides of the ridge, while four species were restricted to the region north of Iceland, and three to the region south of the ridge. Depth (or factors related to depth) appeared to be the most important factor in driving distributional patterns of the studied species. Temperature was also an important driver, but not to the same extent as depth. On the contrary, salinity and sediment type did not have much influence on munnopsid distribution patterns. Hence, the presence of the ridge does not restrict faunal exchange between the northern North Atlantic Ocean and GIN Seas for most of the investigated species, which may be explained by the good swimming abilities and the ecological flexibility of these munnopsid species.},

Attention is paid to the hydro- graphic conditions in the warm water from the south (Inninger Current) which developed at the end of the 1990s into high saline conditions comparable with the period prior to the 1960s. This includes the northern component flowing into North Icelandic waters. The conditions in the East Icelandic Current also improved at the end of the 1990s with relatively high salinities. Thus the hydrobiological conditions in Icelandic waters were favourable at the end of the 1990s with regard to the various fish stocks.

Both families were species rich in the area, in total occurring with 34 species in 20 genera.

Five species were found on both sides of the Ridge, occurring at a wide range of temperatures (−0.9 to {\textgreater}4°C), while another five species extend across the GIF Ridge. Most species occurred in two and more water masses and the species north of the Ridge occurred usually within narrower temperature range than the species living south of the Ridge. The water masses in association with the Ridge seem to limit distribution of most species. Despite similar number of species occurring in the areas north and south of the Ridge, the areas differ considerably in diversity pattern with depth.},

Visual inspection was realized by means of an epibenthic sled equipped with a digital underwater video camcorder and a still camera. For determination of surface sediment characteristics a subsample of sediment from box corer samples or different grabs was collected and analyzed in the lab. Muddy bottoms predominated in the deep basins (Iceland Basin, Irminger Basin, deep Norwegian and Iceland Seas), while sand and gravel dominated on the shelves and the ridges, and in areas with high currents. Organic contents were highest in the deep Norwegian and Iceland Seas and in the Iceland Basin, and at these sites dense aggregations of mobile epibenthic organisms were observed. Large dropstones were abundant in the Iceland Sea near the shelf and in the Denmark Strait. The dropstones carried diverse, sessile epibenthic fauna, which may be underestimated using traditional sampling gear. The paper supplies new background information for studies based on IceAGE material, especially studies related to ecology and taxonomy.},

All populations were the low plate morph; however, populations of Gasterosteus in lakes lacking piscivorous fish had significantly fewer lateral plates than populations in lakes with predatory fish species. Two distinct trophic "morphotypes" were identified, each one associated with a specific lake environment. Populations inhabiting benthic-dominated environments were found to possess reduced gill raker number and reduced gill raker length but increased upper jaw length relative to populations from limnetic environments. We propose that the interpopulation variability in trophic morphology is a response to trophic resource differences between lakes.},

	abstract = {The barrier formed by the Greenland–Scotland-Ridge (GSR) shapes the oceanic conditions in the region around Iceland. Deep water cannot be exchanged across the ridge, and only limited water mass exchange in intermediate layers is possible through deep channels, where the flow is directed southwestward (the Nordic Overflows). As a result, the near-bottom water masses in the deep basins of the northern North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas hold major temperature differences. Here, we use near-bottom measurements of about 88,000 CTD (conductivity–temperature–depth) and bottle profiles, collected in the period 1900–2008, to investigate the distribution of near-bottom properties. Data are gridded into regular boxes of about 11km size and interpolated following isobaths. We derive average spatial temperature and salinity distributions in the region around Iceland, showing the influence of the GSR on the near-bottom hydrography. The spatial distribution of standard deviation is used to identify local variability, which is enhanced near water mass fronts. Finally, property changes within the period 1975–2008 are presented using time series analysis techniques for a collection of grid boxes with sufficient data resolution. Seasonal variability, as well as long term trends are discussed for different bottom depth classes, representing varying water masses. The seasonal cycle is most pronounced in temperature and decreases with depth (mean amplitudes of 2.2°C in the near surface layers vs. 0.2°C at depths {\textgreater}500m), while linear trends are evident in both temperature and salinity (maxima in shallow waters of +0.33°C/decade for temperature and +0.03/decade for salinity).},

It is found that North Atlantic Deep Water formation is favored by a warm climate, while cold climates are more likely to produce Southern Ocean deep water or deep-decoupling oscillations (when the Southern sinking region is halocline covered). This behavior is traced to a cooling-induced convective instability near the North Atlantic sinking region, that is, to unstable horizontal spreading of a halocline that stratifies part of the region. Under the convective instability it is found that climate cooling is generally equivalent to increased freshwater forcing. This is because in a cold climate, high-latitude water masses approach the temperature of maximum density and the convection-driving, upward thermal buoyancy flux induced by surface cooling becomes insufficient to overcome the stratifying effect of surface freshening (a downward buoyancy flux). An extensive halocline is then formed and this halocline interferes with the heat loss necessary for the steady production of North Atlantic Deep Water.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The authors investigate the sensitivity of the thermohaline circulation (THC) with respect to a subpolar salinity perturbation. Such perturbation simulates a freshwater release caused by retreating glaciers or anomalous sea ice. The feedback mechanisms amplifying or damping the initial anomaly are analyzed in the coupled ocean–atmosphere–sea ice model. Their understanding is essential for modeling climate variability on decadal and longer timescales. A 3D ocean circulation model is coupled to an atmospheric energy balance and a thermodynamic sea ice model. The perturbation in the North Atlantic’s subpolar salinity causes a cessation of deep convection and a climate state with decreased oceanic heat transport, decreased high-latitude atmospheric temperature, and larger sea ice extent. The sea ice isolates the atmosphere from the warmer ocean, reducing the heat flux and thus the vertical mixing in the ocean. This change in the local buoyancy flux weakens the large-scale circulation. High-latitude cooling cannot compensate for the freshening since the ocean temperature cannot fall below the freezing point. Because deep convection is suppressed where sea ice is present, North Atlantic deep water formation is rather sensitive to the formation of sea ice. The insulating effect of sea ice is more important than its impact on salinity in our experiments. Different types of boundary conditions are used to isolate relevant feedback processes. The stability of the THC depends crucially on the atmospheric model component. Active atmospheric heat transport allows continued deep water formation because the sea ice margin is shifted poleward.},

In general, we assess non-mitigated projections of future climate change at scales from global to hundreds of kilometres. Further assessments of regional and local climate changes are provided in Chapter 11. Due to an unprecedented, joint effort by many modelling groups worldwide, climate change projections are now based on multi-model means, differences between models can be assessed quantitatively and in some instances, estimates of the probability of change of important climate system parameters complement expert judgement. New results corroborate those given in the Third Assessment Report (TAR). Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates will cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.},

At the same time, effects of in situ environmental conditions on mining activities also need to be considered for effecient performance by the mining system. Differences in the degree of impact have been noticed during the mining simulation experiments by different investigating agencies. Therefore, interparameter comparisons, standardization of methods, and improvement in mining design are important considerations for proper utilization of resources, conservation of environment, and cost efficiency of the mining operations.},

In particular, this is true of the field of phylogeography, a discipline that attempts to describe geographical variation in species using neutral genetic diversity as a correlate of time. Through comparisons of information from multiple species, as well as background information about the abiotic environment and how it has changed over time, we should be able to reassemble many of the forces that were important in assembling the communities and community interactions found in a given region. Here I review the information available for coastal species in the northwestern Atlantic, and argue that an integration of ecological, genetic, geological and oceanographic information can illustrate emergent patterns of community genetics.},

	abstract = {A goal of phylogeography is to relate patterns of genetic differentiation to potential historical geographic isolating events. Quaternary glaciations, particularly the one culminating in the Last Glacial Maximum ∼21 ka (thousands of years ago), greatly affected the distributions and population sizes of temperate marine species as their ranges retreated southward to escape ice sheets. Traditional genetic models of glacial refugia and routes of recolonization include these predictions: low genetic diversity in formerly glaciated areas, with a small number of alleles/haplotypes dominating disproportionately large areas, and high diversity including “private” alleles in glacial refugia. In the Northern Hemisphere, low diversity in the north and high diversity in the south are expected. This simple model does not account for the possibility of populations surviving in relatively small northern periglacial refugia. If these periglacial populations experienced extreme bottlenecks, they could have the low genetic diversity expected in recolonized areas with no refugia, but should have more endemic diversity (private alleles) than recently recolonized areas. This review examines evidence of putative glacial refugia for eight benthic marine taxa in the temperate North Atlantic. All data sets were reanalyzed to allow direct comparisons between geographic patterns of genetic diversity and distribution of particular clades and haplotypes including private alleles. We contend that for marine organisms the genetic signatures of northern periglacial and southern refugia can be distinguished from one another. There is evidence for several periglacial refugia in northern latitudes, giving credence to recent climatic reconstructions with less extensive glaciation.},

	abstract = {Intertidal and subtidal communities of the western and eastern coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean were greatly affected by Pleistocene glaciations, with some taxa persisting on both coasts, and others recolonizing after being extirpated on one coast during the Last Glacial Maximum. In the original spirit of comparative phylogeography, we conducted a comparative analysis using mtDNA sequence data and a hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach for testing these two scenarios across 12 intertidal and subtidal coastal invertebrates spanning the North Atlantic to determine the temporal dynamics of species membership of these two ephemeral communities. Conditioning on a low gene-flow model, our results suggested that a colonization or mitochondrial selective sweep history was predominant across all taxa, with only the bivalve mollusc Mytilus edulis showing a history of trans-Atlantic persistence. Conditioning on a high gene-flow model weakened the support for this assemblage-level demographic history. The predominance of a colonization-type history also highlights concerns about analyses based on single-locus data where genetic hitchhiking may be incorrectly inferred as colonization. In conclusion, driving factors in shifting species range distributions and membership of ephemeral coastal communities could be species-specific environmental tolerances, species interactions, and/or stochastic demographic extinction. Through a re-examination of a long-standing question of North Atlantic phylogeography, we highlight the flexibility and statistical honesty of using a model-based ABC approach.},

How populations diverge and new species form in this remote ecosystem is poorly understood. Phylogeographical analyses have begun to provide some insight into evolutionary processes at bathyal depths ({\textless}3000 m), but much less is known about evolution in the more extensive abyssal regions ({\textgreater}3000 m). Here, we quantify geographical and bathymetric patterns of genetic variation (16S rRNA mitochondrial gene) in the protobranch bivalve Ledella ultima, which is one of the most abundant abyssal protobranchs in the Atlantic with a broad bathymetric and geographical distribution. We found virtually no genetic divergence within basins and only modest divergence among eight Atlantic basins. Levels of population divergence among basins were related to geographical distance and were greater in the South Atlantic than in the North Atlantic. Ocean-wide patterns of genetic variation indicate basin-wide divergence that exceeds what others have found for abyssal organisms, but considerably less than bathyal protobranchs across similar geographical scales. Populations on either side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic differed, suggesting the Ridge might impede gene flow at abyssal depths. Our results indicate that abyssal populations might be quite large (cosmopolitan), exhibit only modest genetic structure and probably provide little potential for the formation of new species.},

We present evidence of several observations of Pseudocalanus moultoni [Frost (1989) Can. J.

Patterns of DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene allow us to confidently identify the species, discriminate it from co-occurring sibling species and infer relationships among the newly discovered and previously sampled P. moultoni populations. Our observations suggest that NE Atlantic populations of P. moultoni are self-sustaining and we discuss potential source populations and pathways of transport.

The flabelliferans decrease diversity from shallow water to deep water and on a south-to-north latitudinal gradient. Although many asellote families are endemic to the deep sea, none of the flabelliferan families appear to have evolved in the abyss. Recent colonisations of the deep sea, which may have been limited to the southern hemisphere by oceanographic conditions, have significant consequences for observed regional diversities of some taxa.

	abstract = {Eurythenes gryllus is one of the most widespread amphipod species, occurring in every ocean with a depth range covering the bathyal, abyssal and hadal zones. Previous studies, however, indicated the existence of several genetically and morphologically divergent lineages, questioning the assumption of its cosmopolitan and eurybathic distribution. For the first time, its genetic diversity was explored at the global scale (Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans) by analyzing nuclear (28S rDNA) and mitochondrial (COI, 16S rDNA) sequence data using various species delimitation methods in a phylogeographic context. Nine putative species-level clades were identified within E. gryllus. A clear distinction was observed between samples collected at bathyal versus abyssal depths, with a genetic break occurring around 3,000 m. Two bathyal and two abyssal lineages showed a widespread distribution, while five other abyssal lineages each seemed to be restricted to a single ocean basin. The observed higher diversity in the abyss compared to the bathyal zone stands in contrast to the depth-differentiation hypothesis. Our results indicate that, despite the more uniform environment of the abyss and its presumed lack of obvious isolating barriers, abyssal populations might be more likely to show population differentiation and undergo speciation events than previously assumed. Potential factors influencing species’ origins and distributions, such as hydrostatic pressure, are discussed. In addition, morphological findings coincided with the molecular clades. Of all specimens available for examination, those of the bipolar bathyal clade seemed the most similar to the ‘true’ E. gryllus. We present the first molecular evidence for a bipolar distribution in a macro-benthic deep-sea organism.},

(2) The Mackenzie Canyon macrofauna, although abundant and diverse, were similarly indistinct from the shelf community at similar depth. However, there was a 10-fold increase in inshore abundance in the upwelling region of Cape Bathurst due to large numbers of the amphipod Ampelisca macrocephala and the polychaete Barantolla americana, species that were not abundant elsewhere. (3) In the inshore fast ice and flaw lead regions of the Beaufort Shelf, under the influence of ice scour, storm effects, coastal erosion and the Mackenzie River, the macrofauna were dominated by the bivalve Portlandia arctica and the polychaete Micronephthys minuta. Offshore, where these influences were less and upwelling of deep Atlantic water occurred, the polychaete Maldane sarsi dominated.

	abstract = {The marine asellote (Isopoda, Crustacea) fauna of the Northern Seas, i.e. the Norwegian, Greenland, Iceland and North Polar Seas, contains 106 species. Most of them occur in shallow waters, but the number of species declines rapidly with increased depth. Half the species are endemic and those occurring also outside the Northern Seas are mainly found in the North Atlantic. The endemism of species is low ({\textless}50\%) at depths {\textless}750 m, but becomes high ({\textgreater}60\%) at depths {\textgreater}750 m. Only a single endemic asellote genus is recorded from the Northern Seas. The low diversity of the deep Arctic asellote isopods is explained partly by a short evolutionary time of the fauna within this environment, but in particular due to isolation of the Greenland-Iceland-Faeroe Ridge, which acts asa barrier against the immigration of species into the Northern Seas and thus shapes the species composition. The hydrographic condition above the ridge may also have restricted the migration of deep-sea species into the Northern Seas. Consequently, the Arctic deep-sea asellote fauna consists predominantly of species belonging to less pronounced deep-sea families (e.g. Desmosomatidae and Nannoniscidae) and genera, or shallow water genera occurring in proximity to the Northern waters, while the most pronounced deep-sea families and genera are poorly represented (e.g. families Haploniscidae and Ischnomesidae) or even absent (e.g. genus Storthyngura). The Arctic deep-sea asellote fauna is considered to have originated mainly from the North Atlantic Ocean.},

Within the macrobenthos on the shelf, peracarids were an important component, besides polychaetes, molluscs and brittle stars. At 22 stations in depths from 45-517 m, about 38 000 specimens were identified and have been listed.
In total, 229 species belonging to 51 families, and 121 genera were found. Seven species assemblages were characterized: the "deep assemblage", the "shallow assemblage", the "Westwind Trough assemblage", the "Norske Trough assemblage", the "common species assemblage", the "high-accumulation area assemblage", and the "ice-associate assemblage". Differences in abundance and composition do not primarily reflect bathymetric gradients, but more the availability of food (phytoplankton, more importantly ice algae incorporation into the sediment) and therefore the temporal and spatial opening of the polynya. It is suggested that primary production, hydrography, and ice conditions (lateral advection due to the \&nbsp;anticyclonic gyre around Belgica Bank, and upwelling at a southern fast-ice extension) are the main factors influencing the peracarid crustacean community.},

	abstract = {The Nordic Seas have one of the highest water-mass diversities in the world, yet large knowledge gaps exist in biodiversity structure and biogeographical distribution patterns of the deep macrobenthic fauna. This study focuses on the marine bottom-dwelling peracarid crustacean taxon Cumacea from northern waters, using a combined approach of morphological and molecular techniques to present one of the first insights into genetic variability of this taxon. In total, 947 specimens were assigned to 77 morphologically differing species, representing all seven known families from the North Atlantic. A total of 131 specimens were studied genetically (16S rRNA) and divided into 53 putative species by species delimitation methods (GMYC and ABGD). In most cases, morphological and molecular-genetic delimitation was fully congruent, highlighting the overall success and high quality of both approaches. Differences were due to eight instances resulting in either ecologically driven morphological diversification of species or morphologically cryptic species, uncovering hidden diversity. An interspecific genetic distance of at least 8\% was observed with a clear barcoding gap for molecular delimitation of cumacean species. Combining these findings with data from public databases and specimens collected during different international expeditions revealed a change in the composition of taxa from a Northern Atlantic-boreal to an Arctic community. The Greenland-Iceland-Scotland-Ridge (GIS-Ridge) acts as a geographical barrier and/or predominate water masses correspond well with cumacean taxa dominance. A closer investigation on species level revealed occurrences across multiple ecoregions or patchy distributions within defined ecoregions.},

	abstract = {Iceland is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, with an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles that is largely unexplored with respect to chemical constituents of the marine biota. Iceland is a geothermally active area and hosts both hot and cold adapted organisms on land and in the ocean around it. In particular, the confluence of cold and warm water masses and geothermal activity creates a unique marine environment that has not been evaluated for the potential of marine natural product diversity. Marine organisms need to protect themselves from other organisms trying to overgrow, and some need to secure their place on the bottom of the ocean. Unexplored and unique areas such as the hydrothermal vent site at the sea floor in Eyjafjordur are of particular interest. In 1992 a collaborative research programme on collecting and identifying benthic invertebrates around Iceland (BIOICE) was established, with participation of Icelandic and foreign institutes, universities and taxonomists on benthic invertebrates from all over the world. Since the programme started almost 2,000 species have been identified and of those 41 species are new to science. Our recent bioprospecting project is directed towards the first systematic investigation of the marine natural product diversity of benthic invertebrates occurring in Icelandic waters, and their potential for drug-lead discovery in several key therapeutic areas.},

Here, a comprehensive summary of protocols for the retrieval of the samples, fixation on board research vessels, PCR amplification and cycle sequencing of altogether six loci (three mitochondrial and three nuclear) is provided. These were adapted from previous protocols and developed especially for asellote Isopoda from deep-sea samples but have been successfully used in some other peracarids as well. In total, about 2300 specimens of isopods, 100 amphipods and 300 tanaids were sequenced mainly for COI and 16S and partly for the other markers. Although we did not set up an experimental design, we were able to analyze amplification and sequencing success of different methods on 16S and compare success rates for COI and 16S. The primer pair 16S SF/SR was generally reliable and led to better results than universal primers in all studied Janiroidea, except Munnopsidae and Dendrotionidae. The widely applied universal primers for the barcoding region of COI are problematic to use in deep-sea isopods with a success rate of 45–79\% varying with family. To improve this, we recommend the development of taxon-specific primers.},

Cumaceans are small crustaceans, generally 1-10mm in size, which occur from tidal to abyssal depths in marine (and brackish) waters throughout the world. They are found in the first few cms of sand or sand/mud substrates; while they may be locally abundant, their distributions are patchy. Cumaceans feed on microorganisms and organic matter and are, in turn, consumed by bottom feeding organisms including a number of fishes.

These malacostracans are distinguished by a combination of features including a large carapace which covers many thorasic somites, a narrow, long abdomen, a forked tail, and, in many families, a telson. The sexes are conspicuously dimorphic: females lack pleopods (with one exception, of course!) and have a large brood chamber. The carapace is ornamented in many lineages and appendages are generally highly modified. The morphology of cumaceans is sufficiently distinctive that members of the order are easy to recognize.},

The aim of a World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) is to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms, including information on synonymy. While highest priority goes to valid names, other names in use are included so that this register can serve as a guide to interpret taxonomic literature.

The content of WoRMS is controlled by taxonomic experts, not by database managers. WoRMS has an editorial management system where each taxonomic group is represented by one or more experts who have the authority over the content, and are responsible for controlling the quality of the information. Each of these main taxonomic editors can invite several specialists of smaller groups within their area of responsibility to join them.

This register of marine species grew out of the European Register of Marine Species (ERMS), and its combination with several other species registers maintained at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ). Rather than building separate registers for all projects, and to make sure taxonomy used in these different projects is consistent, VLIZ developed a consolidated database called ‘Aphia’. A list of marine species registers included in Aphia is available on the website. MarineSpecies.org is the web interface for this database. The WoRMS is an idea that is being developed, and will combine information from Aphia with other authoritative marine species lists which are maintained by others (e.g. AlgaeBase, FishBase, Hexacorallia, NeMys).

Resources to build MarineSpecies.org and Aphia were provided mainly by the EU Network of Excellence ‘Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning’ (MarBEF), and also by the EU funded Species 2000 Europe and ERMS projects. Currently, funding is received through the LifeWatch project, where WoRMS is part of the LifeWatch Taxonomic Backbone.

Aphia contains valid species names, synonyms and vernacular names, and extra information such as literature and biogeographic data. Besides species names, Aphia also contains the higher classification in which each scientific name is linked to its parent taxon. The classification used is a ‘compromise’ between established systems and recent changes. Its aim is to aid data management, rather than suggest any taxonomic or phylogenetic opinion on species relationships.

Keeping WoRMS up-to-date is a continuous process. New information is entered daily by the taxonomic editors and by the members of the Data Management Team. Often data also come in from contributions of large datasets, such as global or regional species lists. No database of this size is without errors and omissions. We can’t promise to make no errors, but we do promise to follow up and give feedback on any communications pointing out errors. Feedback is very welcome!

Access to the data can be obtained either through the online interface or through requesting a download of the database.},

Since the discovery of high species diversity in the deep-sea benthos4, much has been learned about local5,6and regional7–9patterns of diversity. Variation in diversity on larger scales remains poorly described. Latitudinal gradients of diversity were unexpected because it was assumed that the environmental gradients that cause large-scale patterns in surface environments could not affect communities living at great depths10. Here we report that deep-sea bivalves, gastropods and isopods show clear latitudinal diversity gradients in the North Atlantic, and strong interregional variation in the South Atlantic. Many seemingly incompatible mechanisms have been proposed to explain deep-sea species diversity11. The existence of regular global patterns suggests that these mechanisms operate at different spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {The discovery of global-scale latitudinal gradients of declining biodiversity from the tropics to the pole for bivalves, gastropods and isopods in the deep North Atlantic has created a high degree of interest and controversy. This is because
such gradients are commonly associated with solar energy-temperature gradients in terrestrial and shallow water systems and it is difficult to see how these processes might apply to a diversity gradient in the deep North Atlantic, where productivity
increases northwards but diversity declines. Here, we compare biodiversity patterns from marine nematodes, the most abundant deep-sea metazoan, from the deep North Atlantic with previous results and show that rarefaction is potentially unsuitable for
large-scale biogeographic pattern analysis. We obtain a different pattern from that previously obtained for mollusc and isopod data. Nematode diversity, as measured by species count, shows a positive gradient between 13 to 56°N, which is consistent with
the hypothesis that this pattern is related to the productivity gradient in the food-starved deep North Atlantic. The Norwegian Sea appears to be an area of low diversity for reasons connected to historical-geographical processes.},

	abstract = {High diversity in macrobenthos in the deep sea still lacks satisfactory explanation, even if this richness may not be exceptional compared to that in coastal soft sediments. Explanations have assumed a highly ecologically interactive, saturated local community with co-existence controlled by either niche heterogeneity, or spatio-temporal heterogeneity embodying disturbance. All have failed to provide convincing support. Local/regional scale biodiversity relationships support the idea of local richness in macrobenthos being predominantly dependent on the larger, rather local scale. Local-scale ecological interactions seem unlikely to have overriding importance in co-existence of species in the deep sea, even for relatively abundant, ‘core’ species with wide distributions. Variety in observed larger-scale pattern and the strong inter-regional pattern, particularly in the poorly known southern hemisphere, seem to have a pluralistic causation. These include regional-scale barriers and extinctions (e.g., Arctic), and ongoing adaptive zone re-colonisation (e.g., Mediterranean), along with other historical constraints on speciation and migration of species caused by changes in ocean and ocean-basin geometry. At the global scale lack of knowledge of the Antarctic deep sea, for example, blocks coherent understanding of latitudinal species diversity gradients. We need to reconcile emerging understanding of large-scale historical variability in the deep-sea environment—with massive extinctions among microfossil indicators as recently as the Pliocene—to results from cladistic studies indicating ancient lineages, such as asellote isopods, that have evolved entirely within the deep sea. The degree to which the great age, diversity, and high degree of endemism in Antarctic shelf benthos might have enriched biodiversity in the adjacent deep seas basins remains unclear. Basin confluence with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans may have encouraged northwards dispersion of species from and into the deep Antarctic basins so that any regional identity is superficial. Interpretation of the Antarctic deep sea as a diversity pump for global deep-sea biodiversity may simply reflect re-colonisation, via basin confluence, of northern hemisphere areas impoverished by the consequences of rapid environmental change during the Quaternary.},

The community standing stock decreases with depth; this is a universal phenomenon that involves a complex transition in the relative importance of the different size groups. Bacterial abundance and biomass show no decline with depth. All 3 animal size groups experience significant exponential decreases in both abundance and biomass. The abundance of larger animals is significantly lower and decreases more rapidly than for smaller groups. The resulting drop in average body size with depth confirms Thiel’s size-structure hypothesis on very large spatial scales. In terms of their proportion of total community biomass, smaller size classes replace larger size classes. The upper continental slope is dominated by macrofaunal biomass, and the abyss by bacterial and meiofaunal biomass. The dramatic decrease in total community standing stock and the ascendancy of smaller organisms with depth has important implications for deep-sea biodiversity. The bathyal zone (200 to 4000 m) affords more ecological and evolutionary opportunity in the form of energy availability for larger organisms, and consequently supports higher macrofaunal and megafaunal species diversity than the abyss ({\textgreater}4000 m).},

Here, we assess how many marine species are named and estimated to exist, paying particular regard to whether discoveries of deep-sea organisms, microbes and parasites will change the proportion of terrestrial to marine species. We then review what factors have led to species diversification, and how this knowledge informs conservation priorities. The implications of this understanding for marine conservation are that the species most vulnerable to extinction will be large and endemic. Unfortunately, these species are also the most threatened by human impacts. Such threats now extend globally, and thus the only refuges for these species will be large, permanent, fully protected marine reserves.},

An important consequence may be an expansion in the area and volume of so-called oxygen minimum zones, where O2 levels are too low to support many macrofauna and profound changes in biogeochemical cycling occur. Significant deoxygenation has occurred over the past 50 years in the North Pacific and tropical oceans, suggesting larger changes are looming. The potential for larger O2 declines in the future suggests the need for an improved observing system for tracking ocean O2 changes.},

Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility can still be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences.

	abstract = {Establishing management programs to preserve the benthic communities along the NW Pacific and the Arctic Ocean (AO) requires a great understanding of the composition of communities and their responses to environmental stressors. In this study, we thus examine patterns of benthic community composition and patterns of species richness along the NW Pacific and Arctic Seas and investigate the most important environmental drivers of those patterns. Overall we find a trend of decreasing species richness towards higher latitudes and deeper waters, peaking in coastal waters of the eastern Philippines. The most dominant taxa along the entire study area were Arthropoda, Mollusca, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Annelida. We found that depth, not temperature, is the main driver of community composition along the NW Pacific and neighboring Arctic Seas. Depth has been previously suggested as a factor driving speciation in benthic fauna. Following depth, the most influential environmental drivers of community composition along the NW Pacific and the Arctic Ocean were silicate, light, and currents. For example, silicate in Hexactinellida, Holothuroidea, and Ophiuroidea; and light in Cephalopoda and Gymnolaemata had the highest correlation with community composition. In this study, based on a combination of new samples and open-access data, we show that different benthic communities might respond differently to future climatic changes based on their taxon-specific biological, physiological, and ecological characteristics. International conservation efforts and habitat preservation should take an adaptive approach and apply measures that take the differences between benthic communities in responding to future climate change into account. This facilitates implementing appropriate conservation management strategies and sustainable utilization of the NW Pacific and Arctic marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that increased Pacific water transport into the Arctic affects the marine ecosystem. One of the theoretical predictions for a future Arctic characterized by such environmental change is that subarctic taxa will expand northward and invade the native Arctic ecosystem. This study focuses on variation in macrofaunal community composition and the influence of changing physical drivers at known benthic hotspots in the Pacific Arctic. The average number of macrofaunal family-level taxa has increased significantly south of St. Lawrence Island and in the Chirikov Basin, whereas the number of macrofaunal taxa in the southeastern Chukchi Sea showed no significant trend over the 2000–2013 time period. However, the Shannon–Weaver diversity index, based on abundance, did not mirror these regional changes in the number of macrofaunal taxa, indicating that the abundance of newly present taxa was negligible compared to the entire abundance already present. We also investigated temporal variations in meridional sea level gradient and local winds, which contribute 2/3 and 1/3 of the variation in northward volume transport at Bering Strait, respectively. There were significant increasing trends in the meridional sea level gradient and local winds, suggesting the increased northward seawater volume transports over the benthic hotspots could contribute to the expansion of subarctic taxa into these northern Arctic regions. Our data suggest an increase in macrofaunal taxa type with increasing current transport northward into the Pacific Arctic region that could have a strong influence in restructuring the benthic ecosystem in this region in the future.},

	abstract = {A detailed study of paleoclimatic proxy data (stable isotopes, planktonic foraminiferal census data, carbonate content, and Ice Rafted Detritus (IRD)) in the surface sediments of the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas (GIN-seas) shows that different proxies are closely related to the surface water masses, to the position of oceanic fronts and to the sea ice extent. Both stable isotopes, foraminifers and sedimentological data differentiate between Polar water with extensive sea ice cover, Arctic water with only seasonal sea ice cover, and warm Atlantic water. The fronts that border these surface water masses are also well defined. Polar water is characterized by lower carbon and oxygen isotope values than Arctic water, and a slightly lower content of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral in the Polar Front region. Carbonate content is low and IRD input is high in Polar waters. Arctic water has highest carbon and oxygen isotope values, and is completely dominated by N. pachyderma sin. The Arctic Front is reflected by a clear isotopic gradient and by a strong switch from N. pachyderma sin. dominance to Globigerina quinqueloba dominance. Atlantic Water is defined by lower carbon and oxygen isotope values and by dominance of N. pachyderma dextral and increased amounts of Globigerina bulloides. The results have implications for paleoceanographic reconstructions of cold environments and point to the possibility of better defining sea ice margins and convective regions as well as frontal positions in past high latitude oceans. Applying these results to the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas indicates more dynamic and less sea ice covered surface conditions in the GIN-seas than in earlier reconstructions.},

Yet an understanding of the ecology of those communities ultimately requires information on where and how component species live. Many deep-sea isopod families and genera have shallow-water representatives at northern and southern high latitudes. Basic behavioral features of these taxa have been revealed through study of these shallow-waters forms. This report describes behavior seen in aquaria of species within the Janiridae, Munnidae, Paramunnidae, Ischnomesidae, Desmosomatidae, Eurycopidae, and Ilyarachnidae. Observations cover locomotion (walking, swimming, burrowing), feeding, grooming, respiration, brooding, and interindividual behavior. Several activities, particularly concerning grooming and respiration, characterize many of the taxa. Locomotory habits are strongly correlated with morphology, but borrowing is more common than has been predicted from body design, and taxa with natatory conformation were surprisingly reluctant to swim.},

Three different patterns of nocturnal vertical migration were distinguished based on the timing of maximum swimming activity: at dusk; at the beginning of the night; or later in the night. Sexually dimorphic patterns of free-swimming behaviour was observed in Ampelisca and some other species of Amphipoda (Bathyporeia teniupes, Metaphoxusfultoni), and Cumacea (Bodotria pulchella, Pseudocuma longicornis), with many more males than females migrating into the water column at night.

Cumaceans are small crustaceans, generally 1-10mm in size, which occur from tidal to abyssal depths in marine (and brackish) waters throughout the world. They are found in the first few cms of sand or sand/mud substrates; while they may be locally abundant, their distributions are patchy. Cumaceans feed on microorganisms and organic matter and are, in turn, consumed by bottom feeding organisms including a number of fishes.

These malacostracans are distinguished by a combination of features including a large carapace which covers many thorasic somites, a narrow, long abdomen, a forked tail, and, in many families, a telson. The sexes are conspicuously dimorphic: females lack pleopods (with one exception, of course!) and have a large brood chamber. The carapace is ornamented in many lineages and appendages are generally highly modified. The morphology of cumaceans is sufficiently distinctive that members of the order are easy to recognize.},

However, based on external morphological traits and Linnean classification, a few conflicting hypotheses of relatedness have been proposed. Family definitions rely on morphological characters that often overlap and diagnoses are based on a combination of non-unique characters. Morphological analysis does not provide a well-resolved phylogeny. In the present study, we use amino acid sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene to produce a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the families of Cumacea. Phylogenetic analyses at the amino acid level were performed under Bayesian, likelihood, and parsimony methods. Results strongly suggest that families lacking an articulated telson form a monophyletic group. This pleotelson clade, composed of the families Bodotriidae, Leuconidae, and Nannastacidae, is the most derived within the Cumacea. Within this group, the Bodotriidae resolve paraphyletically, with Leuconidae and Nannastacidae embedded within it. Comparison of the molecular phylogeny with that based on morphology suggests that many “diagnostic” characters are homoplasious.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: We present the first global-scale analysis of standing stock (abundance and biomass) for 4 major size classes of deep-sea biota: bacteria, metazoan meiofauna, macrofauna and megafauna. The community standing stock decreases with depth; this is a universal phenomenon that involves a complex transition in the relative importance of the different size groups. Bacterial abundance and biomass show no decline with depth. All 3 animal size groups experience significant exponential decreases in both abundance and biomass. The abundance of larger animals is significantly lower and decreases more rapidly than for smaller groups. The resulting drop in average body size with depth confirms Thiel\&\#146;s size-structure hypothesis on very large spatial scales. In terms of their proportion of total community biomass, smaller size classes replace larger size classes. The upper continental slope is dominated by macrofaunal biomass, and the abyss by bacterial and meiofaunal biomass. The dramatic decrease in total community standing stock and the ascendancy of smaller organisms with depth has important implications for deep-sea biodiversity. The bathyal zone (200 to 4000 m) affords more ecological and evolutionary opportunity in the form of energy availability for larger organisms, and consequently supports higher macrofaunal and megafaunal species diversity than the abyss ({\textgreater}4000 m).},

In this study, we investigate the cophylogenetic patterns of 69 host-virus connections. Prior research has yielded valuable insights into phenomena such as host switching, cospeciation, and other dynamics concerning the interaction between CoVs and bats. Nonetheless, a distinct gap exists in the current literature concerning a comparative cophylogenetic analysis focused on elucidating the contributions of sequence fragments to the coevolution between hosts and viruses. 
Results: Among the 69 host-virus links examined, 47 showed significant cophylogeny based on ParaFit and PACo analyses, affirming strong associations. Focusing on two pivotal proteins, ORF1ab and spike, we conduct a comparative analysis of host and coronavirus phylogenies. For ORF1ab, specific window ranges in the multiple sequence alignment (positions 520-680, 770-870, 2930-3070, and 4910-5080) exhibit the lowest Robinson and Foulds (RF) distance (i.e. 84.62{\textbackslash}\%), emphasizing their higher contribution in the cophylogenetic association. Similarly, within the spike region, distinct window ranges (positions 0-140, 60-180, 100-410, 360-550, and 630-730) display the lowest RF distance at 88.46{\textbackslash}\%. Our analysis identifies six recombination regions within ORF1ab (positions 360-1390, 550-1610, 680-1680, 700-1710, 2060-3090, and 2130-3250), and four within the spike protein (positions 10-510, 50-560, 170-710, and 230-730). The convergence of minimal RF distance regions with combination regions robustly affirms the pivotal role of recombination in viral adaptation to host selection pressures. Furthermore, horizontal gene transfer reveals prominent instances of partial gene transfer events, occurring not only among variants within the same host species but also crossing host species boundaries. This suggests a more intricate pattern of genetic exchange.
Conclusions: By employing a multifaceted approach, our comprehensive approach provides a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted interactions governing the coevolutionary dynamics between bat hosts and CoVs. This deeper insight informs our understanding of viral evolution and adaptation mechanisms, illuminating the broader dynamics driving viral diversity.},

	abstract = {Due to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reaches its peak, researchers around the globe are combining efforts to investigate the genetics of different variants to better deal with its distribution. This paper discusses phylogeographic approaches to examine how patterns of divergence within SARS-CoV-2 coincide with geographic features, such as climatic features. First, we propose a python-based bioinformatic pipeline called aPhylogeo for phylo-geographic analysis written in Python 3 that help researchers better understand the distribution of the virus in specific regions via a configuration file, and then run all the analysis operations in a single run. In particular, the aPhylogeo tool determines which parts of the genetic sequence undergo a high mutation rate depending on geographic conditions, using a sliding window that moves along the genetic sequence alignment in user-defined steps and a window size. As a Python-based cross-platform program, aPhylogeo works on Windows®, MacOS X® and GNU/Linux. The implementation of this pipeline is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/tahiri-lab/aPhylogeo). Second, we present an example of analysis of our new aPhylogeo tool on real data (SARS-CoV-2) to understand the occurrence of different variants.},
