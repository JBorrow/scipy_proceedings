title: "echodataflow: Configurable, Reproducible, and Scalable Fisheries Acoustics Workflows with Prefect"
abstract: |
With the influx of large data from multiple instruments and experiments, scientists are wrangling complex data pipelines that are context-dependent and non-reproducible. We demonstrate how we leverage Prefect, a modern orchestration framework, to facilitate fisheries acoustics data processing. We built a Python package `echodataflow` which 1) wraps common echosounder data processing steps in a few lines of code; 2) allows users to specify workflows and their parameters through editing text “recipes” which provide transparency and reproducibility of the pipelines; 3) supports scaling of the workflows while abstracting the computational infrastructure; 4) provides monitoring and logging of the workflow progress. Under the hood, echodataflow uses Prefect to execute the workflows while providing a domain-friendly interface to facilitate diverse fisheries acoustics use cases. We demonstrate the features through a typical ship survey data processing pipeline.

## Fisheries Acoustics Workflows

While traditionally fisheries acoustics scientists have had a go-to tool and procedures for their data processing and analysis, now they are facing a lot of choices in designing their workflows. The field has also become very interdisciplinary and it involves people from different backgrounds (physics, biology, oceanography, acoustics, signal processing, machine learning, software engineering, etc.) and with different levels of experience. [Figure] shows the many variations of workflows that can be defined based on the data collection scheme, the use case, the data storage and computing infrastructure options. We discuss these in more detail in the next sections.

## Echodataflow Overview
At the center of `echodataflow` design is the notion that a workflow can be configured through a set of recipes (.yaml files) that specify the pipeline, data storage, and logging details. The idea draws inspiration from the Pangeo-Forge Project [@pangeo-forge] which facilitates the Extraction, Transformation, Loading (ETL) of earth science geospatial datasets from traditional repositories to analysis-ready, cloud-optimized (ARCO) data stores [ref]. The pangeo-forge recipes provide a model of how the data should be accessed and transformed, and the project has garnered numerous recipes from the community. While Pangeo-Forge’s focus is on transformation from `.netcdf` [ref] and `hdf5` [ref] formats to `zarr`, echodataflow’s aim is to support full echosounder data processing and analysis pipelines: from instrument raw data formats to biological products. Echodataflow leverages Prefect to abstract data and computation management. In [Figure%s](#fig:echodataflow) we provide an overview of echodataflow’s framework. At the center we see several steps from an echosounder data processing pipeline: `open_raw`, `combine_echodata`, `compute_Sv`, `compute_MVBS`. All these functions exist in the echopype package, and are wrapped by echodataflow into predefined stages. Prefect executes the stages on a dask cluster which can be started locally or can be externally set up. These echopype functions already support distributed operations with dask thus the integration with Prefect within echodataflow is natural. Dask clusters can be set up on a variety of platforms: local, cloud, kubernetes [ref], HPC cluster via `dask-jobqueue` [ref], etc. and allow abstraction from the computing infrastructure. Input, intermediate, and final data sets can live in different storage systems (local/cloud, public/private) and Prefect’s block feature provides seamless, provider-agnostic, and secure integration. Workflows can be executed and monitored through Prefect’s dashboard, while logging of each function is handled by echodataflow.

## Bibliographies, citations and block quotes

Bibliography files and DOIs are automatically included and picked up by `mystmd`.
These can be added using pandoc-style citations `[@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55]`
which fetches the citation information automatically and creates: [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.55].
Additionally, you can use any key in the BibTeX file using `[@citation-key]`,
as in [@hume48] (which literally is `[@hume48]` in accordance with
the `hume48` cite-key in the associated `mybib.bib` file).
Read more about [citations in the MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/citations).

If you wish to have a block quote, you can just indent the text, as in:

> When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication.

> -- @hume48

### DOIs in bibliographies

In order to include a DOI in your bibliography, add the DOI to your bibliography
entry as a string. For example:

```{code-block} bibtex
:emphasize-lines: 7
:linenos:
@book{hume48,
  author    =  "David Hume",
  year      = {1748},
  title     = "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
  address   = "Indianapolis, IN",
  publisher = "Hackett",
  doi       = "10.1017/CBO9780511808432",
}
```

### Citing software and websites

Any paper relying on open-source software would surely want to include citations.
Often you can find a citation in BibTeX format via a web search.
Authors of software packages may even publish guidelines on how to cite their work.

For convenience, citations to common packages such as
Jupyter [@jupyter],
Matplotlib [@matplotlib],
NumPy [@numpy],
pandas [@pandas1; @pandas2],
scikit-learn [@sklearn1; @sklearn2], and
SciPy [@scipy]
are included in this paper's `.bib` file.

In this paper we not only terraform a desert using the package terradesert [@terradesert], we also catch a sandworm with it.
To cite a website, the following BibTeX format plus any additional tags necessary for specifying the referenced content is recommended.
If you are citing a team, ensure that the author name is wrapped in additional braces `{Team Name}`, so it is not treated as an author's first and last names.

```{code-block} bibtex
:emphasize-lines: 2
:linenos:
@misc{terradesert,
  author = {{TerraDesert Team}},
  title  = {Code for terraforming a desert},
  year   = {2000},
  url    = {https://terradesert.com/code/},
  note   = {Accessed 1 Jan. 2000}
}
```

## Source code examples

No paper would be complete without some source code.
Code highlighting is completed if the name is given:

```python
def sum(a, b):
    """Sum two numbers."""

    return a + b
```

Use the `{code-block}` directive if you are getting fancy with line numbers or emphasis. For example, line-numbers in `C` looks like:

```{code-block} c
:linenos: true

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        /* do something */
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number, and emphasizing a line:

```{code-block} c
:linenos: true
:lineno-start: 2
:emphasize-lines: 3
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        /* do something */
    }
```

You can read more about code formatting in the [MyST documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/code).

## Figures, Equations and Tables

It is well known that Spice grows on the planet Dune [@Atr03].
Test some maths, for example $e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta$.
Or maybe an equation on a separate line:

```{math}
g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx
```

or on multiple, aligned lines:

```{math}
\begin{aligned}
g(x) &= \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
     &= \ldots
\end{aligned}
```

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

```{math}
:label: circarea

A(r) = \pi r^2.
```

```{math}
:label: spherevol

V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
```

We can then refer back to Equation {ref}`circarea` or
{ref}`spherevol` later.
The `{ref}` role is another way to cross-reference in your document, which may be familiar to users of Sphinx.

As you can see in @fig:stream and @fig:em, this is how you reference auto-numbered figures.
To refer to a sub figure use the syntax `@label [a]` in text or `[@label a]` for a parenhetical citation (i.e. @fig:stream [a] vs [@fig:stream a]).
For even more control, you can simply link to figures using `[Figure %s](#label)`, the `%s` will get filled in with the number, for example [Figure %s](#fig:stream).

```{list-table} This is the caption for the materials table.
:label: tbl:materials
:header-rows: 1

```

We show the different quantities of materials required in
@tbl:materials.

Unfortunately, markdown can be difficult for defining tables, so if your table is more complex you can try embedding HTML:

:::{table} Area Comparisons (written in html)
:label: tbl:areas-html

<table>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Projection</th><th colspan="3" align="center">Area in square miles</th></tr>
<tr><th align="right">Large Horizontal Area</th><th align="right">Large Vertical Area</th><th align="right">Smaller Square Area<th></tr>
<tr><td>Albers Equal Area   </td><td align="right"> 7,498.7   </td><td align="right"> 10,847.3  </td><td align="right">35.8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Web Mercator        </td><td align="right"> 13,410.0  </td><td align="right"> 18,271.4  </td><td align="right">63.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Difference          </td><td align="right"> 5,911.3   </td><td align="right"> 7,424.1   </td><td align="right">27.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Percent Difference  </td><td align="right"> 44%       </td><td align="right"> 41%       </td><td align="right">43%</td></tr>
</table>
:::

or if you prefer LaTeX you can try `tabular` or `longtable` environments:

```{raw} latex
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
  \hline
  \multirow{2}{*}{\bf Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\bf Area in square miles} \\
  \cline{2-4}
   & \textbf{Large Horizontal Area} & \textbf{Large Vertical Area} & \textbf{Smaller Square Area} \\
  \hline
  Albers Equal Area   & 7,498.7   & 10,847.3  & 35.8  \\
  Web Mercator        & 13,410.0  & 18,271.4  & 63.0  \\
  Difference          & 5,911.3   & 7,424.1   & 27.2  \\
  Percent Difference  & 44\%      & 41\%      & 43\%  \\
  \hline
  \end{longtable*}

  \caption{Area Comparisons (written in LaTeX) \label{tbl:areas-tex}}
\end{table*}
```

Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse[^footnote-3]:

> Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.
