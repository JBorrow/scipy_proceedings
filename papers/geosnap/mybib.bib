  abstract = {In recent years, social marketing principles and techniques have featured at the heart of government proposals for improving health and tackling health inequalities. This, in part, has led to a shift in the type of information and intelligence needed to support service planning at all levels. In particular, there has been increasing interest in the use of commercial geodemographic classification systems. Despite the amount of activity and associated investment in this area, there is evidence of a real lack of understanding among users about the tools themselves, and the added value they are providing in the National Health Service. This paper describes some of the potential applications of geodemographic tools in the health sector, and explores issues for consideration when selecting or using a system. This paper also describes a potentially cost-effective and sustainable model for utilizing geodemographic tools as part of a regional insight function within the health service. {\copyright} 2008 The Royal Society for Public Health.},

  abstract = {Geodemographic classifications provide discrete indicators of the social, economic and demographic characteristics of people living within small geographic areas. They have hitherto been regarded as products, which are the final "best" outcome that can be achieved using available data and algorithms. However, reduction in computational cost, increased network bandwidths and increasingly accessible spatial data infrastructures have together created the potential for the creation of classifications in near real time within distributed online environments. Yet paramount to the creation of truly real time geodemographic classifications is the ability for software to process and efficiency cluster large multidimensional spatial databases within a timescale that is consistent with online user interaction. To this end, this article evaluates the computational efficiency of a number of clustering algorithms with a view to creating geodemographic classifications "on the fly" at a range of different geographic scales.},

It uses Stats19 road accident data from the London Metropolitan Police, specifically postcode information relating to the driver and casualty of each road accident from 1999 to 2003. Experian's Mosaic software was used to append each postcode to a geodemographic Mosaic type. The results showed distinct spatial and statistical prevalence of certain groups within society to be more at risk of being in a road accident. This highlights the need for a more sophisticated understanding of the different risks people face as they engage in the road environment.},

Both deep neural networks are based on autoencoders, which allow automating dimensionality reduction before clustering. The second approach also introduces the idea of geographic convolution in neural networks, which aims to mirror in the geographical domain the approach of graphical convolution, which has revolutionised image processes in the past decade. To test our approaches, we created a geodemographic classification based on the United Kingdom Census 2011 for the county of Leicestershire and compared it to the official 2011 Output Area Classification. Our results show that the two deep neural networks are successful in creating classifications which are statistically similar to the official classification and demonstrate high cluster homogeneity.},

This phenomenon occurred despite population decline in major cities and the physical expansion of their suburbs over the same decades. Simultaneously, arguments for smart growth and redevelopment of decaying urban cores rose in tenor. What smart growth advocates did not consider, however, were the negative impacts of advocating for inner-area redevelopment. Limits to suburban growth can increase urban density but in tandem increase land and housing prices. Smart growth policies can create a loss of affordable housing and accelerate gentrification and displacement. In this chapter, we investigate the relationship between smart growth policies and gentrification. We then detail how a 21st century vision of smart growth can more equitably mitigate the consequences of gentrification.},

  abstract = {In this paper we move away from a static view of neighbourhood inequality and investigate the dynamics of neighbourhood economic status, which ties together spatial income inequality at different moments in time. Using census data from three decades (1980--2010) in 294 metropolitan statistical areas, we use a statistical decomposition method to unpack the aggregate spatiotemporal income dynamic into its contributing components: stability, growth and polarisation, providing a new look at the economic fortunes of diverse neighbourhoods. We examine the relative strength of each component in driving the overall pattern, in addition to whether, how, and why these forces wax and wane across space and over time. Our results show that over the long run, growth is a dominant form of change across all metros, but there is a very clear decline in its prominence over time. Further, we find a growing positive relationship between the components of dispersion and growth, in a reversal of prior trends. Looking across metro areas, we find temporal heterogeneity has been driven by different socioeconomic factors over time (such as sectoral growth in certain decades), and that these relationships vary enormously with geography and time. Together these findings suggest a high level of temporal heterogeneity in neighbourhood income dynamics, a phenomenon which remains largely unexplored in the current literature. There is no universal law governing the changing economic status of neighbourhoods in the US over the last 40 years, and our work demonstrates the importance of considering shifting dynamics over multiple spatial and temporal scales.}

  abstract = {Racial residential segregation is a longstanding topic of focus across the disciplines of urban social science. Classically, segregation indices are calculated based on areal groupings (e.g., counties or census tracts), with more recent research exploring ways that spatial relationships can enter the equation. Spatial segregation measures embody the notion that proximity to one's neighbors is a better specification of residential segregation than simply who resides together inside the same arbitrarily drawn polygon. Thus, they expand the notion of ``who is nearby'' to include those who are geographically close to each polygon rather than a binary inside/outside distinction. Yet spatial segregation indices often resort to crude measurements of proximity, such as the Euclidean distance between observations, given the complexity and data requirements of calculating more theoretically appropriate measures, such as distance along the pedestrian travel network. In this paper, we examine the ramifications of such decisions. For each metropolitan region in the U.S., we compute both Euclidean and network-based spatial segregation indices. We use a novel inferential framework to examine the statistical significance of the difference between the two measures and following, we use features of the network topology (e.g., connectivity, circuity, throughput) to explain this difference using a series of regression models. We show that there is often a large difference between segregation indices when measured by these two strategies (which is frequently significant). Further, we explain which topology measures reduce the observed gap and discuss implications for urban planning and design paradigms.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the long-term impacts of the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) mortgage risk assessment maps on the spatial dynamics of recent income and racial distributions in California metropolitan areas over the 1990-2010 period. We combine historical HOLC boundaries with modern Census tract data and apply recently developed methods of spatial distribution dynamics to examine if legacy impacts are reflected in recent urban dynamics. Cities with HOLC assessments are found to have higher levels of isolation segregation than the non-HOLC group, but no difference in unevenness segregation between the two groups of cities are found. We find no difference in income or racial and ethnic distributional dynamics between the two groups of cities over the period. At the intra-urban scale, we find that the intersectionality of residing in a C or D graded tract that is also a low-income tract falls predominately upon the minority populations in these eight HOLC cities. Our findings indicate that neighborhoods with poor housing markets and high minority concentrations rarely experience a dramatic change in either their racial and ethnic or socioeconomic compositions---and that negative externalities (e.g. lower home prices and greater segregation levels) emanate from these neighborhoods, with inertia spilling over into nearby zones.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the use of geodemographic classifications to investigate the social, economic and spatial dimensions of participation in higher education (HE). Education is a public service that confers very significant and tangible benefits upon receiving individuals: as such, we argue that understanding the geodemography of educational opportunity requires an application-specific classification that exploits under-used educational data sources. We develop a classification for the UK higher education sector, and apply it to the Gospel Oak area of London. We discuss the wider merits of sector specific applications of geodemographics and enumerate the advantages of bespoke classifications for applications in public service provision.},

  abstract = {This review begins by acknowledging the success of geodemographics as an important area of activity in applied geography. However, it then develops a critique of the conceptual and computational underpinnings of the approach, and argues that changes in data supply and online communication have rendered current practices obsolete. It presents elements of a new perspective, entailing: changes in the specification, estimation and testing of online geodemographic systems; adoption of consultative practices from online folksonomies; automated generation of pen portraits; and 'on the fly' visualisation of the outcome of geodemographic classifications. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {There is a long cartographic tradition of describing cities through a focus on the characteristics of their residents. A review of the history of this type of urban social analysis highlights some persistent challenges. In this paper existing geodemographic approaches are extended through coupling the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM), a data-mining technique, with geographic information systems (GIS). This approach allows the construction of linked maps of social (attribute) and geographic space. This novel type of geodemographic classification allows ad hoc hierarchical groupings and exploration of the relationship between social similarity and geographic proximity. It allows one to filter complex demographic datasets and is capable of highlighting general social patterns while retaining the fundamental social fingerprints of a city. A dataset describing 79 attributes of the 2217 census tracts in New York City is analyzed to illustrate the technique. Pairs of social and geographic maps are formally compared using simple pattern metrics. Our analysis of New York City calls into question some assumptions about the functional form of spatial relationships that underlie many modeling and statistical techniques. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
