\begin{abstract}
Cumacea (crustaceans: Peracarida) are vital indicators of benthic health in marine ecosystems. This study investigated the influence of environmental (i.e., biological or ecosystemic), climatic (i.e., meteorological or atmospheric), and geographic (i.e., spatial or regional) attributes on their genetic variability in the Northern North Atlantic, focusing on Icelandic waters. We analyzed mitochondrial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene from 62 Cumacea specimens. Using the \textit{aPhyloGeo} software, we correlated these sequences with relevant variables such as latitude (decimal degree) at the start of sampling, wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling, O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L), and depth (m) at the start of sampling.

Our analyses revealed variability in most spatial and ecosystem attributes, reflecting the diversity of ecological requirements and benthic habitats. The most common Cumacea families, Diastylidae and Leuconidae, suggest adaptations to various marine environments. Phylogeographic analysis showed that specific genetic sequences were correlated with wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L). This indicates potential local adaptation to these fluctuating conditions.

These results reinforce the importance of further research into the relationship between Cumacea genetics and global environmental factors. Understanding these relationships is essential for elucidating the evolutionary dynamics and adaptation of deep-sea Cumacea. This study sheds much-needed light on invertebrate acclimatization to climate change and habitat management in deep waters. It can contribute to the evolution of more efficient conservation strategies and inform policies that protect vulnerable marine ecosystems.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
The North Atlantic and Subarctic regions, particularly the Icelandic waters, are of ecological interest due to their diverse water masses and unique oceanographic features \citep{schnurr_composition_2014, meisner_benthic_2014, uhlir_adding_2021}. These areas form vital {benthic habitats}\footnote{These are areas on the bottom of the oceans or lakes, including sediments and organisms that live in them.} \citep{levin2009ecological} and enhance our understanding of deep-sea ecosystems and biodiversity patterns \citep{rogers2007corals, danovaro2008exponential, uhlir_adding_2021}. The IceAGE project and its predecessors, BIOFAR and BIOICE, provide invaluable data for studying the impacts of climate change and seabed mining, especially in the Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian (GIN) seas \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}. 

Cumacea, a crustacean taxon within Peracarida, provide major indicators of marine ecosystem health due to their sensitivity to environmental fluctuations \citep{stransky_diversity_2010} and their contribution to benthic food webs \citep{rehm2009cumacea}. Despite their ecological importance, deep-sea benthic invertebrates’ evolutionary history and dynamics remain uncharted, notably in the North Atlantic \citep{jennings_phylogeographic_2014}. Interpreting these deep-sea organisms' genetic distribution and demography is central for predicting their response to climate change \citep{jennings_phylogeographic_2014}. 

Considering the current climate emergency, this study aims to analyze the influence of ecological (climatic and environmental) and geographic attributes on the genetics of Cumacea in the Northern North Atlantic. Specifically, we will examine whether there is a correlation between the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene region of Cumacea species sampled and their habitat attributes. If so, we will determine which attributes correlate best with a specific genetic sequence (i.e., window) and identify the potential associated protein. Our approach includes confirming different {phylogeographic models}\footnote{Phylogeographic models are computational tools that analyze relationships between the genetic structures of populations and their geographic distributions. In our case, by incorporating regional, biological, and atmospheric characteristics, we can interpret their impact on the genetic distribution of Cumacea species,} and updating a Python package (currently in beta), \textit{aPhyloGeo}, to simplify these analyses.

This paper is organized as follows: Section \autoref{related-works} reviews pertinent studies on the biodiversity and biogeography of deep-sea benthic invertebrates; Section \autoref{contribution} summarizes the aims and contributions of this study, highlighting aspects relating to the conservation and adaptation of marine invertebrates to climate change; Section \autoref{materials-methods} describes the data collection, sampling procedures, and genetic analyses; Section \autoref{metrics} describes the metrics used to evaluate the phylogeographic models; Section \autoref{results} presents the results; finally, Section \autoref{conclusion} discusses their implications for future research and conservation efforts.

\section{Related Works}\label{related-works}
Assessing and quantifying the biodiversity of deep-sea benthic invertebrates has become increasingly crucial since it was discovered that their species richness may be underestimated \citep{grassle1992deep}. Subsequent research has highlighted the need for large-scale distribution models to interpret the diversity of these organisms across their ecological and evolutionary contexts \citep{rex1997large}. That is why recent efforts have focused on mapping, managing, and studying the seabed \citep{brown2011benthic}. Advanced technologies such as acoustic detection are improving our knowledge of benthic ecosystem complexity \citep{brown2011benthic}. Integrating genetic and habitat attributes gives a deeper understanding of how ecosystemic, meteorological, and spatial attributes influence the genetic differences, distribution, biodiversity, and resilience of deep-sea benthic organisms \citep{vrijenhoek2009cryptic}.

However, the relationship between genetics and the environment is complex, involving gene-environment interactions and natural selection factors, which makes it difficult to identify clear causal relationships \citep{balkenhol_identifying_2009}. In addition, the distinction between the direct and indirect effects of the environment on genetics poses other challenges \citep{manel_perspectives_2010, balkenhol_landscape_2019}. The restrictions of available methods for measuring genetic and ecological attributes, combined with logistical constraints, often limit the scope of such studies \citep{manel_perspectives_2010, shafer_widespread_2013}. This complexity may explain why the environment and genetics of Cumacea have been less studied, even though they are essential for interpreting how these deep-sea invertebrates adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions.

\section{Our Contribution}\label{contribution}
Our study focuses on the genetic fluctuation of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene in cumacean populations in response to variations in their habitat, which has been little explored in previous studies \citep{grassle1992deep, rex2000latitudinal}. We aim to refine the natural selection hypothesis by identifying the genetic region with the highest mutation rate based on the fact that individuals best adapted to their environment are likely to survive and evolve. We then analyze its correlation with geographic and ecological distribution patterns and determine the protein potentially associated with this region. This method represents a major advance over previous research, which has often struggled to integrate genetic and biological data in the context of deep-sea invertebrates \citep{etter1990population, vrijenhoek2009cryptic}.

Using robust analytical methods such as dissimilarity calculations and phylogenetic reconstructions, we provide new insights into the genetic adaptation of marine Cumacea. Unlike previous studies, which have encountered difficulties establishing a link between genetics and the environment \citep{manel2003landscape, balkenhol2009statistical}, our results provide a better understanding of evolutionary dynamics in aquatic ecosystems.

Furthermore, our genetic and environmental data highlights critical habitats of high conservation interest, which can be considered for establishing marine protected areas \citep{levin2009ecological}. These results are essential for developing informed conservation strategies in the context of climate change. Finally, our study paves the way for further research on other invertebrate species across different geographic regions. By extending this research to diverse environments and taxonomic groups, scientists will gain a more complete understanding of the adaptation and resilience of marine invertebrates to changing conditions. This work contributes essential insights to the field and supports the development of informed conservation strategies.

\subsection{Description of the data}
The study area was located in a northern region of the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Sea, the Denmark Strait, and the Norwegian Sea. The specimens examined were collected as part of the IceAGE project (Icelandic marine Animals: Genetic and Ecology; Cruise ship M85/3 in 2011), which focused on the deep continental slopes and abyssal waters around Iceland \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}. The sampling period for the included specimens was from August 30 to September 22, 2011, and they were collected at depths ranging from 316 m to 2568 m. Detailed protocols concerning the sampling plan, sample processing, DNA extraction steps, PCR amplification, sequencing, and aligned DNA sequences are available in \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}.

\subsection{Data pre-processing}
We used data from the article \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}, IceAGE project, and related data from the bold system's database, as described in \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. Given these databases' enormous breadth of features, we applied a selective reduction procedure. Attributes that were not directly relevant to the analysis of correlations between Cumacea genetics and habitat properties, displayed little to no variability (non-numerical data), and had a large number of missing data (> 95\%) were omitted from our study. Out of the 495 available in the IceAGE dataset, we considered 62 specimens for which mitochondrial DNA sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were available. 

Next, we calculated the variance using the $var()$ function in RStudio Desktop 4.3.2 for each of the selected numerical attributes. This step aimed to eliminate attributes with low variation, as they are unlikely to provide critical data to the analysis. We set a variance threshold of ≤ 0.1 to exclude uninformative attributes. The latter allows us to retain attributes whose variability is reasonably sufficient for our analyses while rejecting those that vary little. Only water salinity was eliminated based on this criterion ($S^2 = 0.02146629$). The formula (equation \ref{variance}) and code (\autoref{lst:variance}) used to calculate the variance of our final features, available in the data file on \href{https://github.com/tahiri-lab/Cumacea_aPhyloGeo}{GitHub}, are provided below:

\begin{equation}\label{variance}
    S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
\end{equation}

where $S^2$ is the variance of the attribute, $x_i$ represents each attribute value, $\bar{x}$ is the average of the values for this attribute, and $n$ is the number of values for this attribute in the dataset.

%\autoref{lst:variance}.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:variance,language=R,caption=RStudio script to calculate the variance of each numerical attributes in our final dataset]
# Import data from CSV file
# Read the dataset "Final_Data_Article.csv" and store it in an object called Data.
# The data is read with semicolon (;) as the delimiter.
Data <- read.csv(file = "Final_Data_Article.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

# Calculate the variance of numerical attributes only from the dataset
# This snippet computes the variance for each numerical column.
# Non-numeric columns are excluded from the calculation.
variances <- sapply(Data, function(x) {
  # Check if the column is numeric
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    # Compute variance, excluding NA values
    var(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  } else {
    NA  # Return NA for non-numeric columns
  }
})

# Display variances
# Print the calculated variances for each numerical attribute.
print(variances)
\end{lstlisting}

To refine our dataset, we calculated the Pearson correlation between attributes using the $cor()$ function in RStudio Desktop 4.3.2. Features exhibiting strong correlations with each other (threshold > 0.90) were removed to avoid repetition and guarantee attribute independence. We considered the threshold of > 0.90 to be an adequate compromise between preserving properties for our analyses and eliminating the repetition of information in our data. Since we have three missing data for O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L), we have used the "pairwise.complete.obs method". This method calculates the Pearson correlation matrix using all accessible pairs of observations, even if some data are missing. Using the above threshold, three attributes were discarded: latitude (DD) (Lat_start_end: $r = 0.99966582$), longitude (DD) (Long_start_end: $r = 0.99999794$), and depth (m) (Depth_start_end: $r = 0.99985791$) at the end of sampling. The formula (equation \ref{pearson}) and code (\autoref{lst:pearson}) used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between our final numerical attributes are shown below:

\begin{equation}\label{pearson}
    r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient between two attributes, $x_i$ are the values of an attribute, $y_i$ are the values of another attribute, $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are respectively the averages of the two attributes, and $n$ is the sample size of the two attributes.

%\autoref{lst:pearson}.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:pearson,language=R,caption=RStudio script to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between all the numerical attributes in our final dataset]
# Import data from CSV file
# Read the dataset "Final_Data_Article.csv" and store it in an object called Data.
# The data is read with semicolon (;) as the delimiter.
Data <- read.csv(file = "Final_Data_Article.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

# Select numeric columns only from the dataset
# This code filters the dataset to include only numeric columns.
# Create a new dataframe that contains only the columns with numeric data.
numeric_Data <- Data[sapply(Data, is.numeric)]

# Calculate Pearson correlation matrix
# This code calculates the Pearson correlation matrix for the numeric columns.
# The “pairwise.complete.obs” argument ignores missing values.
correlation_matrix <- cor(numeric_Data, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Display correlation matrix
# Print the resulting Pearson correlation matrix.
print(correlation_matrix)
\end{lstlisting}

This selection of attributes and data resulted in a table containing 62 rows ($n=62$) and 17 columns (number of attributes). 

\subsection{Selected attributes in the IceAGE database}

\subsubsection{Geographic data} 

\begin{itemize}
\item The latitude (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}a) and longitude (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}b) at the start of sampling, both in decimal degrees (DD), as they are intimately linked to the environmental gradients and historical mechanisms modeling genetic heterogeneity \citep{gaither2013origins}.
\item The sectors across the seas around Iceland: the Denmark Strait ($n=28$), the Iceland Basin ($n=15$), the Irminger Basin ($n=12$), the Norwegian Sea ($n=4$), and the Norwegian Basin ($n=3$). 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environmental data} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Depth (m) at the start of sampling (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}c), as well as water temperature ($^\circ$C) (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}e), and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}f), as these are vital elements of the marine ecosystem that have an impact on the distribution and evolutionary acclimatization of marine species \citep{rex2006global, danovaro2010first}. 
\item The sampling sites' sedimentary characteristics directly influence the distribution of Cumacea \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. In this study, they are divided into six ecological niche categories: mud ($n=30$), sandy mud ($n=15$), sand ($n=9$), forams ($n=3$), muddy sand ($n=3$), and gravel ($n=2$).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Climatic data} 
Wind speed (m/s) (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}d) and wind direction at the start and end of sampling were also included, giving the contribution of wind to benthic ecosystem dynamics and the restructuring of species distribution by wind currents and sediment transport \citep{siedlecki2016experiments, waga_recent_2020,saeedi_environmental_2022}. The wind direction at the start of sampling comprises six orientations: South-West ($n=22$), South ($n=15$), North-East ($n=9$), South-South-East ($n=9$), North-West ($n=5$), and East ($n=2$); while that at the end of sampling is composed of seven orientations: South ($n=15$), South-West ($n=15$), North-East ($n=9$), West-South-West ($n=7$), South-East ($n=6$), North-North-West ($n=5$), South-South-East ($n=3$), and East ($n=2$). 

\subsection{Selected attributes in the bold system's database}
\subsubsection{Taxonomic data} 
The family, genus, and scientific name of the cumaceans sampled were integrated into our data to study evolutionary relationships and genetic variation to habitat attributes among the specimens in our dataset. These comprise seven families: Diastylidae ($n=21$), Lampropidae ($n=13$), Leuconidae ($n=12$), Astacidae ($n=7$), Bodotriidae ($n=4$), Ceratocumatidae ($n=3$), and Pseudocumatidae ($n=2$). A total of 21 cumacean species were found in our sample (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}). We have also included the sample identity (id) so that each sample remains unique. Some specimens were identified only to genus ($n=1$) or family ($n=5$) in our sample.

\subsection{Selected attributes from article \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}} 
\subsubsection{Other environmental data} 
The habitat and water mass of the sampling points were the only water attributes taken directly from Table 1 of \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}, as they can give us insight into how they may affect Cumacea genetic diversity and the acclimatization of these species in the GIN seas around Iceland. Thus, the water mass definitions, as described in \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}, were used as a reference: Arctic Polar Water (APW, $n=15$), Iceland Sea Overflow Water (ISOW, $n=15$), North Atlantic Water (NAW, $n=9$), Arctic Polar Water/Norwegian Sea Arctic Intermediate Water (APW/NSAIW, $n=7$), warm Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDWw, $n=8$), Labrador Sea Water (LSW, $n=3$), cold Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDWc, $n=3$), and Norwegian Sea Arctic Intermediate Water (NSAIW, $n=2$) (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). In terms of habitat, we considered the three categories used in \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}: deep sea ($n=38$), shelf ($n=15$), and slope ($n=9$) (Figure \ref{fig:fig5}).

\subsubsection{Genetic data} 
To better interpret benthic species' relationship and evolutionary responses, genetic data are required \citep{wilson_speciation_1987, uhlir_adding_2021}. Thus, the aligned DNA sequence of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene region from each of the samples was included in our analyses. This region is standard in phylogeny and phylogeography studies \citep{hugenholtz1998impact} and sufficiently conserved over time to guarantee exact alignments between different species or populations \citep{saccone1999evolutionary}. We examined 62 of the 306 aligned DNA sequences used for phylogeographic analyses by \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. As some specimens in our sample have their DNA sequence duplicated, or even quadruplicated with a difference of one or two nucleotides, we took into account the longest-aligned DNA sequence of each specimen.

\subsection{{\textit{aPhyloGeo} software}\label{aPhyloGeo-software}}
We used the cross-platform Python software \textit{aPhyloGeo} for our phylogeographic analyses, designed to analyze phylogenetic trees using ecological and geographic attributes (\autoref{lst:main}). Developed by My-Linh Luu, Georges Marceau, David Beauchemin, and Nadia Tahiri, \textit{aPhyloGeo} offers tools to study and identify potential correlations between species genetics and habitat characteristics, enabling us to understand the evolution of species under different environmental conditions \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. 

We selected this software for our analysis because, to our knowledge, it is the first phylogeographic tool capable of correlating species genetics with climatic, environmental, and geographic attributes - precisely the objective of our study \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. The \textit{aPhyloGeo} software offers several key functionalities:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
\item Phylogeographic tree evaluation: The software elucidates the evolutionary relationships between species based on their genetic sequences, which is essential for interpreting phylogeographic models that link the evolution of species to their spatial distribution and their biological and meteorological context \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}.
\item Ecological and regional correlation analysis: It enables correlations between genetic sequences and the mentioned attributes to be tested and visualized. These correlations are crucial for identifying their effect on genetic fluctuations \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}.
\item Investigation of genetic diversity: \textit{aPhyloGeo} measures genetic heterogeneity based on spatial variation, making it possible to recognize potential evolutionary processes (e.g., natural selection, mutation, speciation, and selection pressures) and local adaptations \citep{manel_perspectives_2010}.
\end{enumerate}

The \textit{aPhyloGeo} Python package is freely and publicly available on \href{https://github.com/tahiri-lab/aPhyloGeo}{GitHub}, and is also available on \href{https://pypi.org/project/aphylogeo/}{PyPi}, to facilitate complex phylogeographic analyses. The software process has three main stages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{The first step} was to collect DNA sequences from cumaceans of sufficient quality for the needs of our results \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. In this study, 62 cumaceans samples were selected to represent 62 sequences of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene. We then included two climatic attributes, namely wind speed (m/s) at the start and end of the sampling; three environmental characteristics, such as depth (m) at the start of sampling, water temperature ($^\circ$C), and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L); and two geographic variables, latitude (DD) and longitude (DD) at the start of sampling.

\item \textbf{In the second step}, trees were generated separately from biological, spatial, meteorological, and genetic data. Concerning spatial attributes, we calculated the dissimilarity between each pair of cumaceans from distinct spatial conditions \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. This produced a symmetrical square matrix \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. The {neighbor-joining algorithm}\footnote{It is a method used to construct phylogenetic trees using distance matrices.} was used to build the spatial tree from this matrix \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. Each geographic attribute gives rise to a geographic tree. If there are $m$ windows affected by this attribute, there will be $m$ geographic trees. The same approach was applied to biological, meteorological, and genetic data. 

For genetic data, phylogenetic reconstruction was reiterated to build genetic trees based on 62 mitochondrial 16S rRNA sequences, considering only data within a window that progresses along the alignment \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. This displacement can vary according to the steps and the size of the window defined by the user (their length is determined by the number of base pairs (bp)) \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. 

In our case, we set up the \textit{aPhyloGeo} software as follows: $pairwiseAligner$ for sequence alignment; $Hamming distance$ to measure simple dissimilarities between sequences of identical length; $All distance methods$ to include Least-Square Distance, Robinson-Foulds distance, normalized Robinson-Foulds Distance and Euclidean Distance in our analyses; $Wider Fit by elongating with Gap (starAlignment)$ algorithm takes alignment gaps into account, which is often mandatory in the case of major deletions or insertions in the sequences; $windows_size$: 1 nucleotide (nt); and finally, $step_size$: 10 nt. The last two configurations imply that for each 1 nt window, a phylogenetic tree is produced using the nucleotide of each cumacean, then the window is moved by 10 nt, creating a new tree. Each window in the alignment will give a genetic tree. If there are $n$ windows, there will be $n$ phylogenetic trees. Genetic trees will be used in an object called $T_1$, while spatial and ecological trees will be used in $T_2$.

\item \textbf{In the third step}, the genetic trees constructed in each sliding window are compared with ecosystemic, atmospheric, and regional trees using Robinson-Foulds Distance \citep{robinson_comparison_1981, koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}, normalized Robinson-Foulds Distance, Euclidean Distance, and Least-Squares Distance. These contribute to understanding the correspondence between cumaceans genetic sequences and their habitat. The approach also takes bootstrapping into account \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. The results of these metrics were obtained using the functions $least_square(tree1, tree2)$, $robinson_foulds(tree1, tree2)$, $euclidean_dist(tree1, tree2)$ from the \textit{aPhyloGeo} software and were organized by the main function (\autoref{lst:main}). Those for the normalized Robinson-Foulds Distance are obtained with the function $robinson_foulds(tree1, tree2)$ (see the last line of code in \autoref{lst:robinsonFoulds}). The metric output tells us which of our attributes has the greatest impact on phylogenetic relationships in our samples, based on the magnitude of the metric distances (see Figure \ref{fig:fig6} and Figure \ref{fig:fig7}). 

In addition to identifying the specific attribute, a sliding-window approach enables the precise localization of subtle sequences with high rates of genetic mutation \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. This method requires shifting a fixed-size window over the alignment of genetic sequences, allowing phylogenetic trees to be reconstructed for each part of the sequence. It thus makes it possible to recognize changes in evolutionary relationships along the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene region of the cumacean species. This method is essential for determining whether cumaceans-specific gene sequences in this region of their genome may be affected by certain ecological or spatial attributes of their habitat (see Figure \ref{fig:fig6} and Figure \ref{fig:fig7}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Metrics}\label{metrics}
Our phylogeographic study used four distance metrics to quantify topological differences between phylogenetic trees. It also assesses dissimilarities between genetic sequences and ecological and regional attributes. This enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of cumacean populations in different environmental contexts. 

The following section presents a more concise version of the functions mentioned in the second and third steps of section \autoref{aPhyloGeo-software}:

\subsubsection{Robinson-Foulds Distance}\label{RF}
The Robinson-Foulds Distance (RFD) calculates the distance between phylogenetic trees built in each sliding window ($T_1$) and the attributes (see the list in the first step of the section \autoref{aPhyloGeo-software}) trees ($T_2$) \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. This measurement is used to evaluate the topological differences between the two sets of trees (see Equation \eqref{eq:rf} and \autoref{lst:robinsonFoulds}).

For example, it evaluates the topological differences between a phylogenetic tree built within certain sliding windows defined by the user (see the second step of section \autoref{aPhyloGeo-software}) and a geographic tree built with latitude data (DD) at the start of sampling. A high distance between a specific window and other windows considered in the RFD analysis implies that the habitat feature impacts this particular DNA sequence and, consequently, the phylogenetic relationships of cumacean species.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rf}
    \text{RF}(T_1, T_2) = | \Sigma(T_1) \Delta \Sigma(T_2) |
\end{equation}

where $\text{RF}(T_1, T_2)$ is the Robinson-Foulds Distance between the two sets of trees, $\Sigma(T_1)$ and $\Sigma(T_2)$ are the sets of divisions in trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ and $ \Delta $, the difference between these two sets.

\subsubsection{Normalized Robinson-Foulds Distance}\label{RFnorm}
The normalized Robinson-Foulds Distance (nRFD) scales the RFD to account for the size variations in the trees (number of clades), allowing a more equitable comparison. It scales the distance to a range between 0 and 1. In our context, the distance has been normalized by $2n-6$, where $n$ represents the number of taxa (see Equation \eqref{eq:rf_norm} and the last line of code in \autoref{lst:robinsonFoulds}). 

For example, if the size of tree A (built using attribute A) differs due to missing data, this normalized metric allows us to compare its dissimilarity with tree B (built using attribute B) in a fairer way. In this case, it reveals the relative influence of habitat attribute A on cumacean phylogenetic relationships, independent of tree size.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:rf_norm}
    \text{RF}_{\text{norm}}(T_1, T_2) = \frac{| \Sigma(T_1) \Delta \Sigma(T_2) |}{| \Sigma(T_1) | + | \Sigma(T_2) |}
\end{equation}

where $ \text{RF}_{\text{norm}}(T_1, T_2)$ is the normalized Robinson-Foulds Distance between the two sets of trees, $\Sigma(T_1)$ and $\Sigma(T_2)$ are the sets of divisions in trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ and $ \Delta $, the difference between these two sets.

\subsubsection{Euclidean Distance}\label{euclidean}
Euclidean Distance (ED) measures the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space. In our study, it is used to compare vectors of habitat attributes between species (Equation \eqref{eq:euclidean} and \autoref{lst:euclideanDist}).

By converting habitat attribute values into vectors, we measure the ED between vectors to quantify the dissimilarity between them of different cumacean species. This distance allows us to interpret how these differences influence their evolutionary relationships. For instance, species with similar habitat attribute vectors (low ED) may share closer evolutionary relationships. In contrast, those with a large difference in habitat vectors (high ED) may reveal evolutionary divergences.

For vectors $\mathbf{p} = (p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (q_1, \ldots, q_n)$, the ED between these vectors is calculated as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:euclidean}
    d_{\text{Euclidean}}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_i - q_i)^2}
\end{equation}

where $p_i$ and $q_i$ are the components of the vectors.

\subsubsection{Least-Squares Distance}\label{LS}
The Least squares Distance (LSD) measures the differences between observed and the estimated values by summing the squares of these differences. In the context of phylogeographic trees, it quantifies the overall topological dissimilarity, considering the positions of nodes and branches (Equation \eqref{eq:ls} and \autoref{lst:LeastSquare}).

This metric allows us to understand how these different habitat attributes influence the topological structure of phylogenetic trees. For example, by comparing a tree constructed from the habitat attribute A with a tree built from attribute B, the LSD reveals the impact, high or low, of attribute A on changes in branch position and length.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ls}
    d_{\text{LS}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

where $y_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$ are the observed and estimated values, respectively.

Figure \ref{fig:fig2}, Figure \ref{fig:fig3}, Figure \ref{fig:fig6} and Figure \ref{fig:fig7} were made with Python 3.11, while Figure \ref{fig:fig4} and Figure \ref{fig:fig5} were made with RStudio Desktop 4.3.2.

\section{Results}\label{results}
The violin diagrams shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2} are used to display summary statistics similar to box plots, showing medians (white dots), interquartile ranges (thickened black bars), and the rest of the distributions (thin black lines), except the ``extreme'' points. Wider areas indicate a greater probability of the attributes taking a given value. They summarize the distribution of spatial (latitude and longitude at the start of sampling (DD)), atmospheric (wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling), and ecosystemic (depth (m) at the start of sampling, water temperature ($^\circ$C), and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L)) data. These diagrams are essential for understanding habitat conditions and highlighting attributes that can potentially influence the genetic adaptability of cumaceans.

    \caption{Violin diagrams of two regional attributes, one atmospheric attribute, and three ecosystemic attributes from our sample that provide essential information about the ecological and meteorological conditions of cumaceans habitats. a) Latitude (DD) at the start of sampling (red) suggest that the samples come from two dominant latitudinal (DD) regions (around 61.64 DD and 67.64 DD); b) Longitude (DD) at the start of sampling (yellow) implies that the samples come from two dominant longitudinal (DD) regions (around -26.77 DD and -18.14 DD); c) Depth (m) at the start of sampling (green) suggest that the samples were mainly collected and concentrated at three different depths (m) (around 500 m, 1500 m and 2500 m); d) Wind speed (m/s) at start of sampling (light blue) indicate stable the wind conditions (m/s) at the start of sampling (around 6.00 m/s); e) Water temperature ($^\circ$C) (dark blue) suggest that the samples were mostly collected and concentrated at two different temperatures ($^\circ$C) (around 0.07 $^\circ$C and 2.66 $^\circ$C); f) O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) (pink) implies that the samples were primarily collected and concentrated at two different O\textsubscript{2} concentrations (mg/L) (around 258.39 mg/L and 290.90 mg/L). \label{fig:fig2}}
\end{figure}

Our results revealed variability in most cumaceans habitat attributes, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}. For instance, the median of the latitude at the start of sampling (67.15 DD; Table \ref{fig:tab1}) is higher than the mean (64.83 DD; Table \ref{fig:tab1}), showing an asymmetric distribution skewed towards lower values. This trend is also observed for depth (m) at the start of sampling (Median: 1574.70 m; Mean: 1412.57 m; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}c and Table \ref{fig:tab1}) and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) (Median: 278.77 mg/L; Mean: 271.88 mg/L; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}f and Table \ref{fig:tab1}). The bimodal shape of the latitude distribution curve suggests that samples came from two dominant latitudinal regions at the start of sampling (around 61.64 DD and 67.64 DD; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}a and Table \ref{fig:tab1}). This bimodality is also observed in longitude (DD) at the start of sampling (around -26.77 DD and -18.14 DD; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}b and Table \ref{fig:tab1}), as well as for temperature ($^\circ$C) (around 0.07 $^\circ$C and 2.66 $^\circ$C; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}e and Table \ref{fig:tab1}), and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) (around 258.39 mg/L and 290.90 mg/L; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}f and Table \ref{fig:tab1}).

The median of the longitude (DD) at the start of sampling (-26.21 DD; Table \ref{fig:tab1}) is lower than the mean (-23.12 DD; Table \ref{fig:tab1}), indicating asymmetry on the higher sides (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}b), as does the water temperature ($^\circ$C) (Mean: 1.45 $^\circ$C; Median: 0.71 $^\circ$C; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}e and Table \ref{fig:tab1}). Unlike all the other diagrams in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}, the curve of the depth (m) at the start of sampling (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}c)) has a multimodal shape with three prominent peaks, suggesting that the samples were mainly collected and concentrated at three different depths (around 500 m, 1500 m and 2500 m; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}c).

The mean (6.26 m/s; Table \ref{fig:tab1}) and median (6.00 m/s; Table \ref{fig:tab1}) of wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}d) are fairly similar, with a high density of data around the median (6.00 m/s; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}d and Table \ref{fig:tab1}). This suggests stable wind conditions (m/s) at the start of sampling. The standard deviation of water temperature ($^\circ$C) is relatively high (1.73 $^\circ$C; Table \ref{fig:tab1}) compared to the mean (1.45 $^\circ$C; Table \ref{fig:tab1}), suggesting acclimatization of cumaceans to a variety of habitat temperatures (-0.851 $^\circ$C – 4.28 $^\circ$C; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}e and Table \ref{fig:tab1}). The range of data for O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) shows some variability (245.53 mg/L – 292.97 mg/L; Figure \ref{fig:fig2}f and Table \ref{fig:tab1}) in the environmental conditions. This reflects a diversity of requirements in terms of O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L), with cumaceans potentially affected by the heterogeneity of biogeochemical cycles, such as photosynthesis, respiration, and organic decomposition, which affect depth-dependent dissolved O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L).

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure2.jpg}
    \caption{Frequency distribution of cumacean species in our sample. The bars represent the number of individuals for each species. The percentages (\%) displayed above the bars indicate the relative abundance of each species in the total sample. The mean and median values of the frequency distribution are shown in the top right-hand corner of the histogram. Unlike less represented species, those that are abundant (such as \emph{Leptostylis ampullacea} and \emph{Leucon pallidus}) may have adaptive characteristics that enable them to exploit resources more easily, resist interspecific competition or withstand changing biological conditions. \label{fig:fig3}}
\end{figure}

The distribution and diversity of the various cumacean species found in our sample are shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}. It shows that the most represented species are (\emph{Leptostylis ampullacea} (14.1\%) and \emph{Leucon pallidus} (12.5\%). In contrast, species like \emph{Bathycuma brevirostre} and \emph{Styloptocuma gracillimum} are less represented (1.6\%), implying that some species may have restricted ecological niches or face ecological forces that limit their distribution. The dominance of certain species (such as \emph{Leptostylis ampullacea} and \emph{Leucon pallidus}) suggests that they may have adaptive traits that enable them to make the most of the accessible resources, resist interspecific competition, or survive in fluctuating ecosystemic conditions, aligns with our study’s aim of relating genetic adaptation to habitat characteristics.

    \caption{Distribution of cumacean families by water mass. This histogram represents the frequency of occurrence of the different cumacean families in our samples, classified according to the water mass in which they were collected. Eight water mass categories are represented: Arctic Polar Water (APW), Arctic Polar Water/North Sub-Arctic Intermediate Water (APW/NSAIW), Iceland Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW), Labrador Sea Water (LSW), North Atlantic Water (NAW), North Sub-Arctic Intermediate Water (NSAIW), cold North Sub-Atlantic Deep Water (NSDWc), and warm North Sub-Atlantic Deep Water (NSDWw). Seven families are represented: Astacidae (red), Bodotriidae (brown), Ceratocumatidae (green), Diastylidae (turquoise), Lampropidae (blue), Leuconidae (purple), and Pseudocumatidae (pink). The presence of the Diastylidae (turquoise) family in the majority of water bodies (APW, APW/NSAIW, ISOW, NSAIW, NSDWc, and NSDWw) accentuates the resilience and ecological acclimatization of this family to various ecological niches and conditions. \label{fig:fig4}}
\end{figure}

The following figure supports the objective of our study by showing the distribution of the various cumacean families in the different water bodies (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). The Diastylidae family, for example, is the most common in all water bodies (turquoise color in Figure \ref{fig:fig4}), testifying to its resilience and ecological adaptability to a wide variety of habitat conditions, reminiscent of the dominance of \emph{Leptostylis ampullacea} (Figure \ref{fig:fig3}, 14.1\%) which belongs to the Diastylidae family.

    \caption{Distribution of cumacean families by habitat. This histogram represents the frequency of occurrence of the different cumacean families in our samples, classified according to the habitat in which they were collected. Three habitat categories are represented: Deep sea, Shelf, and Slope. Seven families are represented: Astacidae (red), Bodotriidae (brown), Ceratocumatidae (green), Diastylidae (turquoise), Lampropidae (blue), Leuconidae (purple), and Pseudocumatidae (pink). The presence of cumacean families in more than one habitat, such as Diastylidae (turquoise), Lampropidae (blue), and Leuconidae (purple), may indicate the development of adaptations, whether morphological, physiological, or behavioral, that could favor their persistence in these habitats. \label{fig:fig5}}
\end{figure}

The distribution of samples of the different cumacean families according to the type of habitat where they were collected during sampling is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig5}. The deep-sea habitats show the greatest diversity of families, mainly Diastylidae and Lampropidae, suggesting they are well acclimatized to deep-sea conditions. In contrast, the slope has the lowest diversity, with Diastylidae again the most dominant, implying that some cumacean species have fewer ecological niches or are less adapted to this habitat. Although less diverse than the deep sea, the shelf is dominated by Leuconidae, indicating that this family may be specifically well-acclimated to shelf habitat. These patterns imply that certain families of cumacean, such as the Diastylidae, Lampropidae, and Leuconidae, have developed distinct adaptations (physiological, behavioral, or morphological) to remain in particular ecological niches, reflecting the impact of habitat conditions on the genetic distribution of cumaceans.

\end{figure}

The correlation between the genetic sequences and two attributes, one climatic (wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling) and the other environmental (O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L)) is presented in Figure \ref{fig:fig6} and Figure \ref{fig:fig7}. All the attributes given in the first step of the \autoref{aPhyloGeo-software} section were analyzed and their script and figure will be soon available in the $img$ and $script$ python file on \href{https://github.com/tahiri-lab/Cumacea_aPhyloGeo}{GitHub}. However, only these two attributes showed the most interesting mutation rate. Using four metrics (LSD, RFD, nRFD, and ED), we noticed that the ED is particularly sensitive to our data, manifesting considerable sequence variation at the position in MSA 520-529 amino acids (aa) (ED: 0.8 < x < 0.9; Figure \ref{fig:fig6}d) and 1190-199 aa (ED: 1.2 < x < 1.3; Figure \ref{fig:fig7}d). This implies that these genetic sites are subject to selection pressures or evolutionary changes, due to biological (O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L)) and meteorological conditions (wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling). These results align with our study's aim to identify the genetic region of cumaceans with the highest mutation rate linked to a specific habitat attribute.

These results provide important insight into the genetic adaptation of cumaceans to their environment. These results need to be analyzed in greater depth to certify their involvement, especially in contrast with \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}, which investigated similar topics of environmental and climatic effects on cumaceans distribution and genetics. A more in-depth analysis of the results is available on \href{https://github.com/tahiri-lab/Cumacea_aPhyloGeo}{GitHub} in the supplementary file.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
This study examines the effects of meteorological, regional, and ecosystemic attributes on the genetics of cumaceans in the waters surrounding Iceland. Our main objective is to determine whether there is a  correlation between precise genetic information of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene region (i.e., window) of cumacean species and their habitat attributes. In particular, we aim to identify the attribute most correlated with a specific genetic sequence and the potentially associated protein.

We meticulously curated relevant attributes from the IceAGE project data, the bold systems database, and the \citep{uhlir_adding_2021} study. Some attributes have been excluded for lack of relevance, low variance (threshold ≤ 0.1; e.g., salinity, $S^2 = 0.02146629$), abundant missing data (> 95\%), or high inter-correlation (threshold > 0.9; Lat_start_end: $r = 0.99966582$; Long_start_end: $r = 0.99999794$; Depth_start_end: $r = 0.99985791$) to guarantee the robustness of our analysis. Utilizing this refined dataset, we integrated phylogeographic studies using \textit{aPhyloGeo} software (\autoref{lst:main}), allowing a comprehensive analysis of potential correlations between the genetics of cumacean species and their habitat characteristics. In addition to data distribution representations, DNA sequence analyses have identified specific genetic windows with high mutation rates in response to atmospheric and biological attributes such as wind speed (m/s) at the start of sampling (Position in MSA: 520-529 aa; ED: 0.8 < x < 0.9; Figure \ref{fig:fig6}d) and O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) (Position in MSA: 1190-1199 aa; ED: 1.2 < x < 1.3; Figure \ref{fig:fig7}d). These results imply variable genetic sites that could contribute to the evolutionary acclimatization of cumaceans to their fluctuating environments.

The novelty in our research lies in the exhaustive correlation between habitat attributes and genetic mutability in cumaceans, particularly in identifying genetic windows associated with habitat fluctuations, which has not been widely investigated in previous studies \citep{manel2003landscape, vrijenhoek2009cryptic}. In this case, our integrated method identifies specific genetic regions sensitive to ecosystemic and atmospheric variations. Thus, by seeking to determine which of these two attributes is most closely correlated with their genetic sequence, the potential evidence of proteins related to one of these variable DNA sequences will enable us to depict the functional effects of this genetic adaptation.

Interpreting how marine invertebrates genetically adapt to variations in their habitat can help us better predict their responses to climate change and advance conservation plans to protect them. Identifying the specific attributes that influence genetic variability of Cumacea can contribute to the designation and supervision of marine protected areas, assuring they include habitats crucial to the survival and acclimatization of these species. Thus, our results can inform the management of fishing and seabed mining companies by revealing ecologically vulnerable areas where these disturbances can seriously affect benthic biodiversity.

Furthermore, our results provide essential knowledge to guide future studies on the genetic adaptation of Cumacea and other invertebrates to ecological and regional variability. Based on these findings, future research should focus on additional ecosystemic and meteorological attributes, such as nutrient accessibility, water pH, ocean currents, and the degree of human disturbance, to further improve the interpretation of the complex interactions between genetics and the environment. Broadening the scope of application to other marine species, not just marine invertebrates, and diverse geographic regions would allow us to generalize the results more effectively. With this in mind, longitudinal study models on these species could reflect long-term climatic and biological fluctuations and improve our knowledge of the dynamics of genetic acclimatization.

However, it is important to recognize the limitations of our study. In particular, the three missing data points on O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) and the relatively small sample size ($n=62$) may have induced a bias, which could impact the validity of our interpretations and restrict the generalizability of our results. Moreover, these missing data could provide partial insight into the relationship between O\textsubscript{2} concentration (mg/L) and genetic fluctuation in cumaceans, and our sample size may reduce the statistical power of our results. Future studies should address these gaps by incorporating larger sample sizes and more complete datasets to confirm and expand our conclusions. Additionally, as our research focuses solely on the mitochondrial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, utilizing more elaborate genomic methods, such as whole-genome sequencing, could help us better understand the genetic variety and the global acclimatization mechanisms of marine species. This would provide more comprehensive genetic databases to improve our accuracy and knowledge in identifying existing (and new) marine invertebrate species using DNA barcoding (e.g., mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I (COX1)). Finally, multidisciplinary collaborations between ecology, genetics, and oceanography would be essential to enhance knowledge sharing and its application in future research.
