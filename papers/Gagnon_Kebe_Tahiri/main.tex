\begin{abstract}
Climate change and various anthropogenic factors significantly influence biodiversity and population evolutionary dynamics. To deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving these disturbances within ecosystems, biologists employ phylogeographic approaches. These methods aim to establish the correlation between the genetic structure of populations and their geographical distribution, considering their current or historical geoclimatic history.

Our laboratory focuses on developing bioinformatics tools to enhance phylogeographic analysis. Recognizing the urgency of the current climate crisis, we are conducting an in-depth analysis of the impact of extreme climatic parameters and environmental factors on Cumacea (crustaceans: Peracarida). Our approach includes a comparative study that validates our phylogeographic models against environmental data from the northern waters of the North Atlantic around Iceland. Concurrently, we are updating a Python package (in beta) to facilitate these complex analyses.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
In the vast North Atlantic and subarctic region, the Icelandic region and its surrounding waters offer fascinating ecological interest \citep{schnurr_composition_2014, uhlir_adding_2021}. The waters surrounding Iceland contains a significant diversity of water bodies from various sources \citep{uhlir_adding_2021} often interacting and frequently overlapping \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. These specific oceanographic and hydrographic caracteristics shape benthic habitats through depth gradients, water mass indicators, and a particular arrangement of habitats \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. Therefore, research in these areas enhances our understanding of the deep-sea ecosystems and the patterns of biodiversity found witnin them \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018, uhlir_adding_2021}.

Biological and environmental baseline data collected in these regions by the IceAGE project, as well as its predecessors, BIOFAR (Biology of the Faroe Island; \citep{gerken_cumacea_1999}) and BIOICE (Benthic Invertebrates of Icelandic waters; \citep{omarsdottir_biodiversity_2013}), which studied the biodiversity of the Faroe Islands and Iceland \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}, are an invaluable resource. They provide crucial source of information for understanding two major issues facing present and future generations: the impact of climate change and mining on the seabed. The North Atlantic region around Iceland has been recongnized for decades as a crucial region for the regulation of global thermohaline circulation \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}. The Greenland, Iceland, and Norwegian (GIN) seas, as well as the high-latitude North Atlantic, play a crucial role in modern deep-sea ventilation. The surface waters of this region are vital for the global deep-sea renewal as well as important for the circulation of thermohaline \citep{johannessen_relationship_1994}. One of the most important changes is the formation of cold, deep water \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}. With the loss of Arctic sea ice, the deep-sea formation process slowed down, likely impacting flow and chemistry in the region studied during the IceAGE expedition \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}.

There is growing international interest in deep-sea resource extraction, and mining operations are about to begin in some areas \citep{mengerink_call_2014}. These operations target in particular mid-ocean ridges and other active geothermal areas. The ridges around Iceland include such areas, such as Reykjanes Ridge, which is home to hydrothermal vent sites. Accurately and rigorously assessing the extent of damage and loss of ecosystem services caused by mining activities is difficult without robust baseline data \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}.

Crustaceans of the taxon Peracarida Calman, 1904, often constitute a significant portion of macrobenthic communities in Arctic and subarctic waters \citep{uhlir_adding_2021} and can be widely dispersed over the continental shelf and slope of the northern seas \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. In this study, we focus on the peracarid taxon Cumacea Kr√∏yer, 1846. The latter are mainly bottom-dwelling marine benthic crustaceans, spending a large part of their lives buried in or near sediments \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}. Thus, Cumacea are presumed to have limited dispersal abilities and are unlikely to be able to move great distances \citep{uhlir_adding_2021}.

Unlike the benthic invertebrates that inhabit rocky intertidal environments of the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic \citep{ilves_colonization_2010, jennings_phylogeographic_2014}, the available information on the evolutionary history and dynamics of deep-sea benthic invertebrates in the North Atlantic remains limited \citep{jennings_phylogeographic_2014}. A homogenous genetic structure with the expansion of North Atlantic populations farther towards the poles has been detected (e.g., \citep{aarbakke_discovery_2011}), emphasizing the role and importance of considering climate change in range expansion \citep{jennings_phylogeographic_2014}. Although studies reveal interesting patterns of genetic distribution of benthic invertabrates from the deep-sea (e.g., \citep{jennings_phylogeographic_2014}), it is fundamental to better understand the origin and demography of deep Atlantic biota in order to deepen our understading of their contemporary connectivity in an evolutionary context as well as to grasp their relationship with ongoing climate change. Continued warming opens up transarctic routes \citep{jennings_phylogeographic_2014}.

In the context of the current climate emergency, this study aims to undertake an in-depth analysis of the influence of extreme climatic parameters and environmental peculiarities on Cumacea (crustaceans: Peracarida). Thus, we wish to determine if there is a correlation between the genetic information of regions of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene of these species and the physical characteristics of their habitats. Our approach includes a comparative study to validate our different phylogeographic models by comparing them to the environmental factors found in the waters of the North Atlantic around Iceland. At the same time, we will be updating a Python package (in beta) to facilitate these complex analyses.

\section{Related Works}\label{related-works}
Many studies have investigated the relationship between genetics and the climatic conditions of their study region. These studies have provided a better understanding of how organisms adapt to their habitat and evolve in it over time \citep{barrett_molecular_2011, fc_genomic_2012}. They have also helped develop conservation plans to maintain biodiversity and protect endangered species by designing how populations are adapted to their environment \citep{balkenhol_identifying_2009}.

\cite{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022} proposed a phylogeographic approach based on an algorithm called aPhyloGeo to study the correlation between Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and their geographical characteristics. More recently, \cite{li_aphylogeo-covid_2023} have developed an interactive platform called aPhyloGeo-Covid to facilitate these analyses.  We elaborate on the aPhyloGeo software as well as its use in this study later in this article.

A study by \cite{ghalambor_adaptive_2007} has demonstrated that habitat characteristics, such as water temperature, can affect the genetics of guppy populations (Poecilla reticulata) by shaping their phenotypic plasticity as well as by promoting rapid genetic adaptation. \cite{cheviron_genomic_2012} also concluded that there was a correlation between vertebrate genetics and habitat properties, particularly in extreme environments such as high altitudes. This correlation between genetics and environmental characteristics was also supported by the results of studies of Threespine Sticklebacks \citep{fc_genomic_2012}. Those results aren't suprinsing consider that species acclimatization to climate change is often the result of the interaction between genetic variation among populations and selection pressures caused by environmental changes \citep{hoffmann_climate_2011}.

However, studies have highlighted the complexity of the relationships between genetics and the environment that can be influenced by many factors such as genotype-environment interaction and natural selection. This can make it difficult to identify unambiguous causal relationships between these two parameters \citep{manel_perspectives_2010}. Other studies mention that it is difficult to distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of the environment on genetics \citep{manel_perspectives_2010, balkenhol_landscape_2019}. Studies of the effect of the environment on the genetics of organisms may be limited by the methods available to measure genetic and environmental characteristics, as well as by logistical constraints related to data collection and generation \citep{manel_perspectives_2010, shafer_widespread_2013}. To our knowledge, this last point must contribute in particular to the fact that research on the environment and genetics of Cumacea is little explored.

As stipulated in hypothesis of Darwin, individuals best adapted to their environment are likely to survive, reproduce and evolve. The objective of this study is to deepen and strengthen the natural selection hypothesis by examining whether there are one or more locations within Cumacea DNA sequences that could better correlate them with their environment.


\section{Materials and Methods}\label{materials-methods}

\subsection{Description of the data}
The study area is located in a northern area of the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Sea, the Denmark Strait, and the Norwegian Sea. The specimens included in this study were collected during the international IceAGE (Icelandic marine Animals: Genetic and Ecology; Cruise ship M85/3 in 2011; \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}) aboard the Meteor RV that explored the deep continental slopes and abyssal waters around Iceland \citep{meisner_prefacebiodiversity_2018}. The data considered in this study from the IceAGE expedition are available via the study of \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}. The sampling period for the specimens included in this study is from August 30 to September 22, 2011, and they were collected in a depth range of 316-2568 m. A description of the sampling plan and sample processing is provided in \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}. The steps of DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing, as well as the extracted and aligned DNA sequences, are also available in the article by \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}.

\subsection{Data pre-processing}
We considered data from the IceAGE project as well as data from the BOLD Systems database, both of which are available via the article by \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}. Given the large range of attributes from these databases, we made a succinct selection of the number of attributes and samples across them. Thus, we omitted attributes that were not relevant in the context of this study, that were completely or nearly invariable (non-numerical data) as well as those that had abundant missing data (> 95\%). We considered 62 of the 495 datasets from the IceAGE project.

Subsequently, we calculated the variance for each of the selected numeric attributes in order to eliminate those with zero or low variance (cut-off ‚â• 0.1):

\begin{equation}
S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
\end{equation}

where \( S^2 \) is the variance of the sample, \( x_i \) represents each value in the data set, \( \bar{x} \) the average of all values in the data set, and \( n \) the number of values in the data set.

Of the previously selected numerical attributes, only salinity was removed (\( S^2 = 0.02146629 \)). This selection of attributes and data resulted in a data table containing 62 rows (\( n=62 \)) and 18 columns (number of attributes). Figures \ref{fig:fig1} and \ref{fig:fig2} were made from Python 3.11.

\begin{figure}[]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure1.jpg}
    \caption{Geographical coordinates at the beginning of the collection of each sample. \label{fig:fig1}}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure2.jpg}
    \caption{Geographical coordinates at the end of the collection of each sample. \label{fig:fig2}}
\end{figure}

From the IceAGE database, 14 attributes were selected. These consist of the geographical coordinates such as longitude (decimal) and latitude (decimal) taken at the beginning (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}a and \ref{fig:fig1}b) and at the end of the collection of each sample. The increase in latitude, in particular, has been highlighted by several studies as being linked to the loss of marine biodiversity on a global scale \citep{rex_global-scale_1993, lambshead_latitudinal_2000, gage_diversity_2004}. These geographic data are divided into five sectors across the seas around Iceland: the Denmark Strait (\( n=28 \)), the Iceland Basin (\( n=15 \)), the Irminger Basin (\( n=12 \)), the Norwegian Sea (\( n=4 \)) and the Norwegian Basin (\( n=3 \)). For the environmental attributes in this database, we included the depth (m) at the beginning and end of sampling (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}c) as well as the temperature (\( \degree C \)) (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}d) and oxygen concentration (mg/L) (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}e) of the water depending on the depth at which the specimens were sampled. These properties of water bodies are drivers of deep-sea biodiversity and biogeography with oxygen being a limiting factor for living organisms \citep{keeling_ocean_2010}. In addition to these contributions, the increase in depth \citep{rex_global_2006, roberts_cold-water_2009, costello_marine_2017} as well as the decrease in water temperature at depth \citep{lambshead_latitudinal_2000} are also factors in the loss of marine biodiversity on a global scale. Meteorological parameters such as speed (m/s) (see Figure \ref{fig:fig1}f) and wind direction at the beginning and end of sampling were also included in our data given the contribution of wind to the restructuring of the benthic ecosystem through water transport \citep{saeedi_environmental_2022, waga_recent_2020}. The wind direction at the start of sampling consists of six orientations: South-West (\( n=22 \)), South (\( n=15 \)), North-East (\( n=9 \)), South-South-East (\( n=9 \)), North-West (\( n=5 \)) and East (\( n=2 \)); while the one at the end of the sampling is made up of seven orientations: South (\( n=15 \)), South-West (\( n=15 \)), North-East (\( n=9 \)), West-South-West (\( n=7 \)), South-East (\( n=6 \)), North-North-West (\( n=5 \)), South-South-East (\( n=3 \)) and East (\( n=2 \)). In addition, we have included the sedimentary characteristics of the sampling sites as factors influencing the distribution of Cumacea \citep{uhlir_adding_2021} and which, for the purposes of this study, fall into six categories: mud (\( n=30 \)), sandy mud (\( n=15 \)), sand (\( n=9 \)), forams (\( n=3 \)), muddy sand (\( n=3 \)) and gravel (\( n=2 \)).

In the BOLD Systems database, taxonomic ranks such as family, genus, and species of the sampled Cumacea were included in our data. These are composed of seven families of Cumacea: Diastylidae (\( n=21 \)), Lampropidae (\( n=13 \)), Leuconidae (\( n=12 \)), Nannastacidae (\( n=7 \)), Bodotriidae (\( n=4 \)), Ceratocumatidae (\( n=3 \)) and Pseudocumatidae (\( n=2 \)). A total of 21 species of Cumacea are found in our sample (see Figure \ref{fig:fig2}).

The habitat and water mass of the sampling points are the only attributes that were taken directly via Table 1 of \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}. Thus, the definitions of water bodies described by \cite{ostmann_marine_2014} were used as a reference for the GIN seas around Iceland: Arctic Polar Water (APW, \( n=15 \)), Iceland Sea Overflow Water (ISOW, \( n=15 \)), North Atlantic Water (NAW, \( n=9 \)), Arctic Polar Water/Norwegian Sea Arctic Intermediate Water (APW/NSAIW, \( n=7 \)), warm Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDWw, \( n=8 \)), Labrador Sea Water (LSW, \( n=3 \)), cold Norwegian Sea Deep Water (NSDWc, \( n=3 \)) and Norwegian Sea Arctic Intermediate Water (NSAIW, \( n=2 \)). In terms of habitat, we considered the three categories used in \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}: deep sea (\( n=38 \)), shelf (\( n=15 \)) and slope (\( n=9 \)).

The aligned DNA sequence of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene region of each of the samples will also be included in our analyses. Thus, we consider 62 of the 306 aligned DNA sequences that were used for phylogenetic analyses of \cite{uhlir_adding_2021}. Since some of the specimens in our sample have their DNA sequence aligned duplicated, or even quadrupled with a difference of one to two nucleotides, we consider the longest aligned DNA sequence for each of the specimens.

\subsection{aPhyloGeo software}

For our analyses, we use the cross-platform Python software aPhyloGeo designed to analyze phylogenetic trees using climate parameters. Developed by Nadia Tahiri, Georges Marceau and David Beauchemin, the latter offers tools to study the correlations between the genetics of species and their habitats, thus allowing the understanding of the evolution of species under different environmental conditions. The software process takes place in three main steps. 

    The first step is to collect Cumacea DNA sequences of sufficient quality for the requirements of our results \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. A total of 62 Cumacea samples were selected to represent 62 sequences of the gene mitochondrial 16S rRNA. Subsequently, we included 6 climatic factors, namely the temperature and O2 concentration of the water as well as the wind speed and direction at the beginning and end of the sample. We also included 9 geographical factors, such as the body of water, the type of habitat and the type of sediment where the samples were collected. The latitude, longitude and depth of sample collection at the beginning and end of sampling were also considered among our geographical parameters.

    In the second step, the trees were generated with climatic, geographical and genetic data. For the geographic parameters, we calculated the dissimilarity between each pair of data from different geographic conditions, which produced a symmetric square matrix. From this matrix, the neighbor junction algorithm was used to design the climate tree. The same approach was applied to climatic and genetic data. Using the 62 sequences of the gene of mitochondrial 16S rRNA, phylogenetic reconstruction is repeated to build gene trees, considering only the data within a range that moves along the alignment. This displacement can vary depending on the steps and window size set by the user (their length is defined by the number of base pairs (pb)) \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}.

    In the third step, the phylogenetic trees built in each sliding window are compared to climatic and geographic parameters using the Robinson and Foulds (RF) topological distance \citep{robinson_comparison_1981, koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}. The distance was normalized by $2n-6$, where $n$ represents the number of taxa. The approach also considers bootstraping. Thus, the use of the sliding window ensures detailed identification of regions with high genetic mutation rates \citep{koshkarov_phylogeography_2022}.

In short, we want to demonstrate a potential correlation between parts of the genes containing a high rate of mutations according to the geographical distribution of Cumacea samples.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The objective of this study is to perform an in-depth analysis of the influence of extreme climatic variables and environmental characteristics around Iceland on Cumacea (crustaceans: Peracarida) based on phylogeographic analysis. To date, we have selected relevant attributes for our study based on data from the IceAGE project, BOLD Systems, and the study by \cite{uhlir_adding_2021} and eliminated those that were not relevant to this study as well as those that had low variance (salinity, \( S^2 = 0.02146629 \)) or abundant missing data (>95\%). Thus, the first part consisted mainly of literature review, data collection, data pre-processing, and data analysis.

For the upcoming fall semester, we are planning several crucial steps. First, we'll cluster our data to better understand climate data partitioning. Next, we'll update our Python package (in beta), dedicated to simplifying phylogeographic analyses. We also plan to conduct a thorough genetic analysis to examine the genetic diversity of our samples. In addition, we will analyze the cross-integration of climate and genetic data to better understand the interactions between the environment and the genetics of the populations studied. Finally, we plan to submit a scientific paper before the end of November.
