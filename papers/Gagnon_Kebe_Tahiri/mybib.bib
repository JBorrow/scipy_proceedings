	abstract = {We present the first global-scale analysis of standing stock (abundance and biomass) for 4 major size classes of deep-sea biota: bacteria, metazoan meiofauna, macrofauna and megafauna. The community standing stock decreases with depth; this is a universal phenomenon that involves a complex transition in the relative importance of the different size groups. Bacterial abundance and biomass show no decline with depth. All 3 animal size groups experience significant exponential decreases in both abundance and biomass. The abundance of larger animals is significantly lower and decreases more rapidly than for smaller groups. The resulting drop in average body size with depth confirms Thiel’s size-structure hypothesis on very large spatial scales. In terms of their proportion of total community biomass, smaller size classes replace larger size classes. The upper continental slope is dominated by macrofaunal biomass, and the abyss by bacterial and meiofaunal biomass. The dramatic decrease in total community standing stock and the ascendancy of smaller organisms with depth has important implications for deep-sea biodiversity. The bathyal zone (200 to 4000 m) affords more ecological and evolutionary opportunity in the form of energy availability for larger organisms, and consequently supports higher macrofaunal and megafaunal species diversity than the abyss ({\textgreater}4000 m).},

Since the discovery of high species diversity in the deep-sea benthos4, much has been learned about local5,6and regional7–9patterns of diversity. Variation in diversity on larger scales remains poorly described. Latitudinal gradients of diversity were unexpected because it was assumed that the environmental gradients that cause large-scale patterns in surface environments could not affect communities living at great depths10. Here we report that deep-sea bivalves, gastropods and isopods show clear latitudinal diversity gradients in the North Atlantic, and strong interregional variation in the South Atlantic. Many seemingly incompatible mechanisms have been proposed to explain deep-sea species diversity11. The existence of regular global patterns suggests that these mechanisms operate at different spatial and temporal scales.},

We present evidence of several observations of Pseudocalanus moultoni [Frost (1989) Can. J. Zool., 67, 525–551] in fjords of Svalbard and northern Norway; this species has previously been known to occur only on the east and west coasts of North America. Patterns of DNA sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene allow us to confidently identify the species, discriminate it from co-occurring sibling species and infer relationships among the newly discovered and previously sampled P. moultoni populations. Our observations suggest that NE Atlantic populations of P. moultoni are self-sustaining and we discuss potential source populations and pathways of transport. In light of recent reports of climate-driven shifts in distributional ranges of marine zooplankton, accurate species identification is essential for monitoring and understanding marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {High diversity in macrobenthos in the deep sea still lacks satisfactory explanation, even if this richness may not be exceptional compared to that in coastal soft sediments. Explanations have assumed a highly ecologically interactive, saturated local community with co-existence controlled by either niche heterogeneity, or spatio-temporal heterogeneity embodying disturbance. All have failed to provide convincing support. Local/regional scale biodiversity relationships support the idea of local richness in macrobenthos being predominantly dependent on the larger, rather local scale. Local-scale ecological interactions seem unlikely to have overriding importance in co-existence of species in the deep sea, even for relatively abundant, ‘core’ species with wide distributions. Variety in observed larger-scale pattern and the strong inter-regional pattern, particularly in the poorly known southern hemisphere, seem to have a pluralistic causation. These include regional-scale barriers and extinctions (e.g., Arctic), and ongoing adaptive zone re-colonisation (e.g., Mediterranean), along with other historical constraints on speciation and migration of species caused by changes in ocean and ocean-basin geometry. At the global scale lack of knowledge of the Antarctic deep sea, for example, blocks coherent understanding of latitudinal species diversity gradients. We need to reconcile emerging understanding of large-scale historical variability in the deep-sea environment—with massive extinctions among microfossil indicators as recently as the Pliocene—to results from cladistic studies indicating ancient lineages, such as asellote isopods, that have evolved entirely within the deep sea. The degree to which the great age, diversity, and high degree of endemism in Antarctic shelf benthos might have enriched biodiversity in the adjacent deep seas basins remains unclear. Basin confluence with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans may have encouraged northwards dispersion of species from and into the deep Antarctic basins so that any regional identity is superficial. Interpretation of the Antarctic deep sea as a diversity pump for global deep-sea biodiversity may simply reflect re-colonisation, via basin confluence, of northern hemisphere areas impoverished by the consequences of rapid environmental change during the Quaternary.},

	abstract = {A detailed study of paleoclimatic proxy data (stable isotopes, planktonic foraminiferal census data, carbonate content, and Ice Rafted Detritus (IRD)) in the surface sediments of the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas (GIN-seas) shows that different proxies are closely related to the surface water masses, to the position of oceanic fronts and to the sea ice extent. Both stable isotopes, foraminifers and sedimentological data differentiate between Polar water with extensive sea ice cover, Arctic water with only seasonal sea ice cover, and warm Atlantic water. The fronts that border these surface water masses are also well defined. Polar water is characterized by lower carbon and oxygen isotope values than Arctic water, and a slightly lower content of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral in the Polar Front region. Carbonate content is low and IRD input is high in Polar waters. Arctic water has highest carbon and oxygen isotope values, and is completely dominated by N. pachyderma sin. The Arctic Front is reflected by a clear isotopic gradient and by a strong switch from N. pachyderma sin. dominance to Globigerina quinqueloba dominance. Atlantic Water is defined by lower carbon and oxygen isotope values and by dominance of N. pachyderma dextral and increased amounts of Globigerina bulloides. The results have implications for paleoceanographic reconstructions of cold environments and point to the possibility of better defining sea ice margins and convective regions as well as frontal positions in past high latitude oceans. Applying these results to the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas indicates more dynamic and less sea ice covered surface conditions in the GIN-seas than in earlier reconstructions.},

	abstract = {Establishing management programs to preserve the benthic communities along the NW Pacific and the Arctic Ocean (AO) requires a great understanding of the composition of communities and their responses to environmental stressors. In this study, we thus examine patterns of benthic community composition and patterns of species richness along the NW Pacific and Arctic Seas and investigate the most important environmental drivers of those patterns. Overall we find a trend of decreasing species richness towards higher latitudes and deeper waters, peaking in coastal waters of the eastern Philippines. The most dominant taxa along the entire study area were Arthropoda, Mollusca, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Annelida. We found that depth, not temperature, is the main driver of community composition along the NW Pacific and neighboring Arctic Seas. Depth has been previously suggested as a factor driving speciation in benthic fauna. Following depth, the most influential environmental drivers of community composition along the NW Pacific and the Arctic Ocean were silicate, light, and currents. For example, silicate in Hexactinellida, Holothuroidea, and Ophiuroidea; and light in Cephalopoda and Gymnolaemata had the highest correlation with community composition. In this study, based on a combination of new samples and open-access data, we show that different benthic communities might respond differently to future climatic changes based on their taxon-specific biological, physiological, and ecological characteristics. International conservation efforts and habitat preservation should take an adaptive approach and apply measures that take the differences between benthic communities in responding to future climate change into account. This facilitates implementing appropriate conservation management strategies and sustainable utilization of the NW Pacific and Arctic marine ecosystems.},

Ocean models predict declines of 1 to 7\% in the global ocean O2 inventory over the next century, with declines continuing for a thousand years or more into the future. An important consequence may be an expansion in the area and volume of so-called oxygen minimum zones, where O2 levels are too low to support many macrofauna and profound changes in biogeochemical cycling occur. Significant deoxygenation has occurred over the past 50 years in the North Pacific and tropical oceans, suggesting larger changes are looming. The potential for larger O2 declines in the future suggests the need for an improved observing system for tracking ocean O2 changes.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that increased Pacific water transport into the Arctic affects the marine ecosystem. One of the theoretical predictions for a future Arctic characterized by such environmental change is that subarctic taxa will expand northward and invade the native Arctic ecosystem. This study focuses on variation in macrofaunal community composition and the influence of changing physical drivers at known benthic hotspots in the Pacific Arctic. The average number of macrofaunal family-level taxa has increased significantly south of St. Lawrence Island and in the Chirikov Basin, whereas the number of macrofaunal taxa in the southeastern Chukchi Sea showed no significant trend over the 2000–2013 time period. However, the Shannon–Weaver diversity index, based on abundance, did not mirror these regional changes in the number of macrofaunal taxa, indicating that the abundance of newly present taxa was negligible compared to the entire abundance already present. We also investigated temporal variations in meridional sea level gradient and local winds, which contribute 2/3 and 1/3 of the variation in northward volume transport at Bering Strait, respectively. There were significant increasing trends in the meridional sea level gradient and local winds, suggesting the increased northward seawater volume transports over the benthic hotspots could contribute to the expansion of subarctic taxa into these northern Arctic regions. Our data suggest an increase in macrofaunal taxa type with increasing current transport northward into the Pacific Arctic region that could have a strong influence in restructuring the benthic ecosystem in this region in the future.},

	abstract = {Iceland is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, with an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles that is largely unexplored with respect to chemical constituents of the marine biota. Iceland is a geothermally active area and hosts both hot and cold adapted organisms on land and in the ocean around it. In particular, the confluence of cold and warm water masses and geothermal activity creates a unique marine environment that has not been evaluated for the potential of marine natural product diversity. Marine organisms need to protect themselves from other organisms trying to overgrow, and some need to secure their place on the bottom of the ocean. Unexplored and unique areas such as the hydrothermal vent site at the sea floor in Eyjafjordur are of particular interest. In 1992 a collaborative research programme on collecting and identifying benthic invertebrates around Iceland (BIOICE) was established, with participation of Icelandic and foreign institutes, universities and taxonomists on benthic invertebrates from all over the world. Since the programme started almost 2,000 species have been identified and of those 41 species are new to science. Our recent bioprospecting project is directed towards the first systematic investigation of the marine natural product diversity of benthic invertebrates occurring in Icelandic waters, and their potential for drug-lead discovery in several key therapeutic areas.},

	abstract = {The oceans appear ideal for biodiversity — they have unlimited water, a large area, are well connected, have less extreme temperatures than on land, and contain more phyla and classes than land and fresh waters. Yet only 16\% of all named species on Earth are marine. Species richness decreases with depth in the ocean, reflecting wider geographic ranges of deep sea than coastal species. Here, we assess how many marine species are named and estimated to exist, paying particular regard to whether discoveries of deep-sea organisms, microbes and parasites will change the proportion of terrestrial to marine species. We then review what factors have led to species diversification, and how this knowledge informs conservation priorities. The implications of this understanding for marine conservation are that the species most vulnerable to extinction will be large and endemic. Unfortunately, these species are also the most threatened by human impacts. Such threats now extend globally, and thus the only refuges for these species will be large, permanent, fully protected marine reserves.},

	abstract = {The Greenland–Scotland Ridge (GSR) is a major topographic feature, extending from Greenland to Scotland. It constrains the water exchange between the northernmost North Atlantic Ocean and the Greenland, Iceland and Norwegian Seas (GIN Seas) and thus forms a potential barrier for faunal exchange from the Arctic to the North Atlantic (and vice versa). Recently an increase in Atlantic water inflow has been observed, leading to changes in physical parameters (i.e. temperature and salinity), which may have an impact on the resident fauna. In this study, we analyzed the composition and distribution of six selected genera of the isopod family Munnopsidae (Crustacea) occurring north and south of the GSR. We examined 82 epibenthic sledge samples and 26 additional sub-samples taken in the course of the Benthic Invertebrates of Icelandic Waters (BIOICE) and Icelandic Marine Animals: Genetics and Ecology (IceAGE) projects, respectively, covering a total depth range from 103 to 2752m depth. Overall, 58 of the evaluated stations originated in the area north of the GSR, while the remaining 50 samples were collected south of the ridge. In total, 10517 individuals could be assigned to 15 species, most belonging to the genus Eurycope Sars, 1864. Due to the presence of the GSR as well as differences in the environment, we expected significant dissimilarities in faunal composition between the two study areas. However, most species (8) occurred on both sides of the ridge, while four species were restricted to the region north of Iceland, and three to the region south of the ridge. Depth (or factors related to depth) appeared to be the most important factor in driving distributional patterns of the studied species. Temperature was also an important driver, but not to the same extent as depth. On the contrary, salinity and sediment type did not have much influence on munnopsid distribution patterns. Hence, the presence of the ridge does not restrict faunal exchange between the northern North Atlantic Ocean and GIN Seas for most of the investigated species, which may be explained by the good swimming abilities and the ecological flexibility of these munnopsid species.},

	abstract = {Intertidal and subtidal communities of the western and eastern coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean were greatly affected by Pleistocene glaciations, with some taxa persisting on both coasts, and others recolonizing after being extirpated on one coast during the Last Glacial Maximum. In the original spirit of comparative phylogeography, we conducted a comparative analysis using mtDNA sequence data and a hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach for testing these two scenarios across 12 intertidal and subtidal coastal invertebrates spanning the North Atlantic to determine the temporal dynamics of species membership of these two ephemeral communities. Conditioning on a low gene-flow model, our results suggested that a colonization or mitochondrial selective sweep history was predominant across all taxa, with only the bivalve mollusc Mytilus edulis showing a history of trans-Atlantic persistence. Conditioning on a high gene-flow model weakened the support for this assemblage-level demographic history. The predominance of a colonization-type history also highlights concerns about analyses based on single-locus data where genetic hitchhiking may be incorrectly inferred as colonization. In conclusion, driving factors in shifting species range distributions and membership of ephemeral coastal communities could be species-specific environmental tolerances, species interactions, and/or stochastic demographic extinction. Through a re-examination of a long-standing question of North Atlantic phylogeography, we highlight the flexibility and statistical honesty of using a model-based ABC approach.},

	abstract = {The Nordic Seas have one of the highest water-mass diversities in the world, yet large knowledge gaps exist in biodiversity structure and biogeographical distribution patterns of the deep macrobenthic fauna. This study focuses on the marine bottom-dwelling peracarid crustacean taxon Cumacea from northern waters, using a combined approach of morphological and molecular techniques to present one of the first insights into genetic variability of this taxon. In total, 947 specimens were assigned to 77 morphologically differing species, representing all seven known families from the North Atlantic. A total of 131 specimens were studied genetically (16S rRNA) and divided into 53 putative species by species delimitation methods (GMYC and ABGD). In most cases, morphological and molecular-genetic delimitation was fully congruent, highlighting the overall success and high quality of both approaches. Differences were due to eight instances resulting in either ecologically driven morphological diversification of species or morphologically cryptic species, uncovering hidden diversity. An interspecific genetic distance of at least 8\% was observed with a clear barcoding gap for molecular delimitation of cumacean species. Combining these findings with data from public databases and specimens collected during different international expeditions revealed a change in the composition of taxa from a Northern Atlantic-boreal to an Arctic community. The Greenland-Iceland-Scotland-Ridge (GIS-Ridge) acts as a geographical barrier and/or predominate water masses correspond well with cumacean taxa dominance. A closer investigation on species level revealed occurrences across multiple ecoregions or patchy distributions within defined ecoregions.},

	abstract = {Due to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reaches its peak, researchers around the globe are combining efforts to investigate the genetics of different variants to better deal with its distribution. This paper discusses phylogeographic approaches to examine how patterns of divergence within SARS-CoV-2 coincide with geographic features, such as climatic features. First, we propose a python-based bioinformatic pipeline called aPhylogeo for phylo-geographic analysis written in Python 3 that help researchers better understand the distribution of the virus in specific regions via a configuration file, and then run all the analysis operations in a single run. In particular, the aPhylogeo tool determines which parts of the genetic sequence undergo a high mutation rate depending on geographic conditions, using a sliding window that moves along the genetic sequence alignment in user-defined steps and a window size. As a Python-based cross-platform program, aPhylogeo works on Windows®, MacOS X® and GNU/Linux. The implementation of this pipeline is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/tahiri-lab/aPhylogeo). Second, we present an example of analysis of our new aPhylogeo tool on real data (SARS-CoV-2) to understand the occurrence of different variants.},

	abstract = {The discovery of global-scale latitudinal gradients of declining biodiversity from the tropics to the pole for bivalves, gastropods and isopods in the deep North Atlantic has created a high degree of interest and controversy. This is because
such gradients are commonly associated with solar energy-temperature gradients in terrestrial and shallow water systems and it is difficult to see how these processes might apply to a diversity gradient in the deep North Atlantic, where productivity
increases northwards but diversity declines. Here, we compare biodiversity patterns from marine nematodes, the most abundant deep-sea metazoan, from the deep North Atlantic with previous results and show that rarefaction is potentially unsuitable for
large-scale biogeographic pattern analysis. We obtain a different pattern from that previously obtained for mollusc and isopod data. Nematode diversity, as measured by species count, shows a positive gradient between 13 to 56°N, which is consistent with
the hypothesis that this pattern is related to the productivity gradient in the food-starved deep North Atlantic. The Norwegian Sea appears to be an area of low diversity for reasons connected to historical-geographical processes.},
